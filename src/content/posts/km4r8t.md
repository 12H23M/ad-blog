Every November, my mother calls me with the same question: "When are you coming for kimjang?" It's not really a question. It's a summons. I pack up the kids, drive to her place, and spend an entire weekend up to my elbows in salted cabbage, chili paste, and garlic — surrounded by my mom, my aunts, and enough napa cabbage to fill a small truck. We've done this every year for as long as I can remember, and my mother did it with her mother before that.

This is kimchi to us. Not just a side dish in a jar — it's a family ritual, a seasonal rhythm, a taste that runs so deep it's practically in our DNA. So let me walk you through what kimchi actually is, because there's a lot more to it than most people outside Korea realize.

## It's Not Just One Thing

Here's what surprises most foreigners: kimchi isn't a single food. It's an entire category. There are over 200 documented varieties of kimchi in Korea, each made with different vegetables, seasonings, and techniques. When people outside Korea say "kimchi," they almost always mean baechu kimchi — the spicy red napa cabbage kind. And sure, that's the most popular one. But it's a bit like saying "cheese" and only ever meaning cheddar.

Let me introduce you to the ones we actually eat at home on a regular basis.

**Baechu Kimchi (배추김치)** is the flagship, the one that accounts for about 70% of all kimchi consumed in Korea. Whole napa cabbages are halved, soaked in salt water for hours, then each leaf gets hand-rubbed with a paste of gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes), garlic, ginger, fish sauce, and salted shrimp. It's labor-intensive, which is exactly why we make it as a family. Fresh baechu kimchi has a bright, crispy bite. Leave it fermenting for a few weeks and it turns sour, tangy, and deeply complex — perfect for stews and fried rice.

**Kkakdugi (깍두기)** is diced radish kimchi — crunchy white cubes coated in that same red chili paste. It's quicker to make than baechu kimchi because you just chop and mix, no leaf-by-leaf rubbing required. My kids love kkakdugi because the pieces are bite-sized and satisfying to crunch on. You'll see this one served automatically with seolleongtang (ox bone soup) and most Korean soup restaurants. There's something about the spicy crunch paired with a milky, bland broth that just works perfectly.

**Oi Sobagi (오이소박이)** is stuffed cucumber kimchi, and it's strictly a summer thing. Small Korean cucumbers are scored into quarters — kept connected at one end — and the pocket gets packed with seasoned chives and radish. It's fresh, crunchy, and mildly spicy. I make a batch whenever the weather gets hot and we eat it within a few days. It doesn't keep long, but it doesn't need to.

**Chonggak Kimchi (총각김치)** uses small ponytail radishes, fermented whole with their green tops still attached. The name literally means "bachelor" — supposedly the radishes resemble the braids unmarried men wore back in Joseon dynasty times. It has a firmer, crunchier texture than kkakdugi and a more peppery kick. My mom always makes a massive batch during kimjang and it lasts well into spring.

**Baek Kimchi (백김치)** is the white kimchi — no red pepper at all. It's seasoned with garlic, pine nuts, chestnuts, jujubes, and sometimes Korean pear, all stored in a mild, fruity brine. This is the one I give my youngest when he complains that "everything is too spicy." It's also the gateway kimchi I recommend for foreigners who are nervous about heat. The flavor is gentle but surprisingly complex.

**Dongchimi (동치미)** is a radish water kimchi — whole small radishes floating in a cold, tangy brine. We drink the brine as much as we eat the radish. On a hot day, cold dongchimi broth is genuinely refreshing. It's also the traditional base for naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles) — the broth you slurp those icy noodles in often starts as dongchimi liquid.

## Every Family Has Their Own Recipe

One thing you should know: there's no single "correct" kimchi recipe. Every Korean family has their own version, passed down through generations and tweaked along the way. My mother's kimchi is heavier on garlic and lighter on fish sauce than my mother-in-law's. My aunt in Busan makes hers noticeably spicier and saltier, which is typical of southern-style kimchi.

This isn't random — there are real regional patterns.

**Seoul-style** kimchi tends to be moderate in spice, not too salty, with light shrimp paste (saeujeot) for seasoning. It's balanced and refined, designed to complement rather than overpower.

**Southern provinces** (Jeolla-do, Gyeongsang-do) go bold. More garlic, more chili, stronger fermented fish sauce. Jeolla Province is particularly famous for its richly flavored kimchi — people there take enormous pride in their version. My Busan aunt would argue hers is the best in Korea, and honestly, she might be right.

**Northern-style** kimchi is milder, often with less chili and sometimes no fermented seafood at all. It tends to be more watery and gentler in flavor. Baek kimchi and dongchimi are more common in northern traditions.

**Gangwon Province**, the mountainous east coast region, makes lighter kimchi that lets the fresh vegetable flavors shine through without heavy seasoning.

When you eat at a Korean restaurant, the kimchi served as banchan (side dishes) reflects whoever's family recipe the kitchen follows. That's why kimchi tastes different everywhere you go. And that's how it should be.

## Kimjang: The Biggest Food Event of the Year

If you visit Korea in late November or early December, you might notice an unusual amount of activity. Families hauling enormous quantities of napa cabbage. Apartment parking lots turned into temporary kimchi-making stations. News broadcasts reporting on cabbage prices like it's stock market coverage.

This is kimjang season — the annual tradition of making enough kimchi to last through winter. UNESCO recognized it as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013, and not just for the food itself, but for what the act of making it together represents: family cooperation, community sharing, and the passing down of knowledge from one generation to the next.

In my family, kimjang is an all-hands event. My mom leads. She's been doing this for over 40 years and her hands move on autopilot — salting, draining, mixing the paste, rubbing each cabbage leaf. The aunts handle the radish and the seasonings. I do whatever my mom tells me. My kids? They mostly eat the fresh-made kimchi straight off the cutting board, which I suppose counts as quality control.

The scale is impressive. We typically make enough to fill two full-sized kimchi refrigerators — yes, most Korean households own a separate refrigerator just for kimchi. It's a tall, narrow fridge with precise temperature controls designed to keep kimchi at the ideal fermentation temperature. Walk into any Korean appliance store and you'll see entire sections devoted to kimchi fridges. That should tell you how seriously we take this.

Traditionally, kimchi was stored in large earthenware jars called onggi, buried in the ground to stay cool through winter. Some families in the countryside still do this. But for most of us in the city, the kimchi fridge has replaced the buried jar — same principle, less digging.

## How We Actually Eat Kimchi (It Goes With Everything)

Here's something that might surprise you: we eat kimchi at almost every single meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. It's always there on the table, no exceptions. Most Korean households keep several types going at once — fresh baechu kimchi for eating as-is, older fermented kimchi for cooking, kkakdugi for soups, maybe some baek kimchi for the kids.

But kimchi is also a cooking ingredient, not just a side dish. Some of our most beloved comfort foods are built entirely around it.

**Kimchi Jjigae (김치찌개)** is the dish that uses up well-fermented, sour kimchi. It's a bubbling stew with pork belly, tofu, and aged kimchi, served in a stone pot still boiling when it hits the table. Every Korean household makes this at least once a week. It's our version of comfort food — the thing you want when it's cold, when you're tired, when nothing else sounds good.

**Kimchi Bokkeumbap (김치볶음밥)** is kimchi fried rice — chopped old kimchi stir-fried with leftover rice, maybe some spam or bacon, topped with a fried egg and a drizzle of sesame oil. This is what I make on nights when I'm too tired to cook properly. Takes ten minutes and the kids demolish it.

**Kimchi Jeon (김치전)** is a savory kimchi pancake, crispy on the outside and tangy on the inside. Chop fermented kimchi, mix it into a simple flour batter, and pan-fry it flat. It's the go-to rainy day food in Korea — something about the sound of sizzling batter and the smell of toasting kimchi feels right when it's pouring outside. Best enjoyed with a glass of makgeolli (Korean rice wine).

**Budae Jjigae (부대찌개)**, or "army stew," throws kimchi in with ramen noodles, spam, hot dogs, American cheese, and baked beans. It sounds chaotic, and it is, but the kimchi is what ties the whole mess together.

## Tips for Foreigners Trying Kimchi

If you're visiting Korea and new to kimchi, here's my honest advice.

**Start with baek kimchi or fresh geotjeori.** These are the mildest options — no fermented funk, gentle heat or none at all. If you order bibimbap at most restaurants, the banchan lineup will usually include something mild alongside the spicy stuff.

**Don't judge kimchi by the smell alone.** Fermented kimchi smells strong. There's no way around that. But the taste is completely different from what the smell suggests. Give it a bite before you decide.

**Try it with rice.** Eating kimchi on its own can be overwhelming if you're not used to fermented flavors. Wrap a piece of kimchi around a spoonful of warm white rice — the rice mellows the tang and the salt, and suddenly it clicks.

**Aged kimchi in stews is more forgiving.** If raw fermented kimchi is too intense, try kimchi jjigae or kimchi fried rice first. Pair it with [Korean BBQ](/food/kb3r9m) and you have the perfect meal. Cooking transforms the flavor — you can even get great pre-made kimchi at [convenience stores](/food/cv7n3k) these days. It into something deeply savory and less sharp.

**The fridge section at Korean supermarkets is your playground.** Places like E-Mart and Lotte Mart have entire refrigerated aisles of different kimchi varieties — you can buy small packages of kkakdugi, baek kimchi, and baechu kimchi to try them all without committing to a giant container.

## More Than Food

Koreans often say that rice is the body of a meal and kimchi is the soul. That sounds dramatic, but I don't think it's an exaggeration. Kimchi is present at every meal in every Korean household, from the fanciest restaurant to a student's dorm room. It connects us to our families (through those kimjang weekends), to our regions (through local recipes), and to our history (through a tradition that stretches back centuries).

My younger son started helping with kimjang last year — his hands are still too small to properly rub the paste into the cabbage leaves, but he tries. He complained about the garlic smell on his fingers for three days afterward. But when he ate the first batch of fresh kimchi and said "this is the best one yet," I knew the tradition was safe for at least one more generation.

That's the thing about kimchi. It's not just something we eat. It's something we make, together, every year, and have for hundreds of years. And honestly, I think that's what makes it taste so good.
