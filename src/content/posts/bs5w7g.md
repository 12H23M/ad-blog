My husband's family is from Busan, so we make the trip down from Seoul several times a year. Every single time, stepping off the KTX and catching that first hint of salt air, I'm reminded why this city is so different from where I live. Seoul is fast, vertical, all glass and neon. Busan is wide open — ocean on one side, mountains on the other, and a pace of life that makes you slow down whether you planned to or not.

Most foreign visitors treat Busan as a quick side trip from Seoul. A day, maybe two. That's a mistake. Busan has its own food, its own dialect, its own attitude, and honestly, its own version of Korea that you won't find anywhere else. Give it at least three days. You won't regret it.

## Getting There (It's Easier Than You Think)

The KTX high-speed train from Seoul Station to Busan Station takes about 2 hours and 30 minutes. Tickets cost around 59,800 won one way. You can book online through the Korail app or website, or just buy tickets at the station. Trains run frequently — roughly every 20 to 30 minutes during peak hours.

If you're on a budget, express buses from Seoul's Express Bus Terminal take about 4 to 5 hours and cost around 23,000 to 34,000 won depending on the class. Comfortable enough, and you save a decent chunk of money.

Busan also has its own international airport (Gimhae), so you could fly in directly if you're coming from Japan, Southeast Asia, or other parts of Korea. Gimhae is smaller and less hectic than Incheon, which is honestly a relief.

Once you're in Busan, the subway system covers most major areas. Grab a T-money card if you don't have one already — it works the same as in Seoul. Taxis are cheap and plentiful, especially useful for getting to Gamcheon Culture Village or places the subway doesn't quite reach.

## The Neighborhoods You Need to Know

Busan is spread out along the coastline, so each neighborhood has a distinct personality. Here's where to spend your time.

**Haeundae (해운대)** is the beach everyone knows. Wide sandy shore, tall buildings behind it, and the kind of energy that makes you want to stay until sunset. During summer, it gets packed — we're talking shoulder-to-shoulder packed. If you visit in spring or fall, though, you get the beach without the crowd, and it's genuinely beautiful. Walk along the Haeundae Coastal Trail toward Dongbaek Island for a quieter stretch with ocean views that will make you stop and stare. My mother-in-law insists the walk to Dongbaek is the best thing about Haeundae, and I've stopped arguing with her about it because she's right.

**Gwangalli (광안리)** is the other beach, and locals tend to prefer it. It's smaller than Haeundae but has a more laid-back feel. The real draw is the nighttime view of Gwangan Bridge, lit up in changing colors across the water. The beachfront is lined with cafes, bars, and raw fish restaurants. This is where I'd go for an evening walk and dinner. Grab a table at one of the outdoor seafood spots, order a plate of hoe (raw fish), and just watch the bridge lights shift while you eat.

**Gamcheon Culture Village (감천문화마을)** is that colorful hillside neighborhood you've probably seen on Instagram. It started as a settlement for Korean War refugees in the 1950s — families building makeshift homes up a steep hillside. In 2009, a public art project transformed the area into what it is today: narrow alleys lined with murals, sculptures, and painted houses stacked up the slope like a pastel-colored amphitheater. It's beautiful, but it's also a real neighborhood where people actually live, so keep your voice down in the residential lanes. Get there early in the morning before the tour groups arrive. Wear shoes with good grip — those stairs are no joke, especially after rain.

**Nampo-dong and Jagalchi (남포동/자갈치)** form the old heart of Busan. Nampo-dong has Gukje Market (one of Korea's largest traditional markets), BIFF Square (named after the Busan International Film Festival), and narrow food streets crammed with vendors. Jagalchi is right next door — Korea's biggest seafood market, run largely by the famously tough Jagalchi ajummas (market women) who've been selling fish here for decades. If you want to eat the freshest sashimi of your life, this is the place. Point at something in the tank, they'll slice it for you on the spot, and you eat it upstairs with soy sauce and wasabi.

**Seomyeon (서면)** is Busan's commercial center — the place locals actually go for shopping, eating, and nightlife. It doesn't have the tourist-friendly packaging of Haeundae or Gamcheon, but that's the point. Jeonpo Cafe Street is worth exploring if you're a coffee person. And at night, the streets around Seomyeon fill up with pojangmacha (street bar tents), fried chicken joints, and karaoke rooms. This is where you'll feel the real Busan energy.

## What to Eat (Busan Food Is Its Own Thing)

Seoul has great food. But Busan has food that is uniquely, stubbornly its own. Many of the city's signature dishes trace back to the Korean War, when refugees improvised meals with whatever ingredients they could find. Those survival recipes became beloved traditions.

**Dwaeji Gukbap (돼지국밥)** is Busan's signature comfort dish — a milky pork bone broth served piping hot with tender slices of pork, rice on the side, and a spread of condiments including salted shrimp, raw garlic, and pickled radish. During the Korean War, refugees made this soup using pork parts that American soldiers didn't use. It stuck, and now there's an entire street in Seomyeon dedicated to it. My father-in-law eats this at least three times a week and claims it's the secret to his health. A bowl costs between 8,000 and 12,000 won — deeply satisfying, especially on a cold day.

**Milmyeon (밀면)** is Busan's version of cold noodles. Thin, chewy wheat noodles served in an ice-cold broth with cucumber, radish, and a boiled egg. The story is similar — northern refugees used wheat flour from U.N. relief supplies to recreate something close to their hometown naengmyeon (buckwheat cold noodles). The result became its own dish entirely. You can get it "mul" (in broth) or "bibim" (mixed with spicy sauce, no broth). Mul milmyeon on a hot summer day is one of life's simple pleasures. Head to Choryang or Dong-gu for the oldest, most authentic spots.

**Ssiat Hotteok (씨앗호떡)** is the street snack that defines Busan. Regular hotteok — the pan-fried sweet pancakes you find all over Korea — are filled with brown sugar syrup. Busan's version stuffs them with a generous handful of mixed seeds: sunflower, pumpkin, peanut, and sometimes sesame. They're bigger, crunchier, and less cloyingly sweet than the Seoul version. The most famous vendors line up at BIFF Square in Nampo-dong, and the line is always long. Fair warning: they come out scorching hot. Bite a tiny hole in the corner first and let the steam escape unless you want to burn the roof of your mouth. I learned this the hard way as a kid visiting my in-laws, and my younger son made the exact same mistake last year.

**Fresh Seafood at Jagalchi** deserves its own mention. The market is a sensory experience — tanks of live fish, octopus, sea squirts, abalone, and things you might not even recognize. You pick what you want from the first floor, they prepare it, and you eat upstairs at simple tables. A sashimi platter for two or three people runs about 30,000 to 50,000 won depending on what you order. The fish is so fresh it's almost unfair to compare it to sushi restaurants elsewhere. If raw fish makes you nervous, the grilled fish sets are just as good and much more approachable.

**Eomuk (어묵)** — Busan-style fish cake — is leagues above the fish cake you get in Seoul convenience stores. Busan takes fish cake seriously. There are entire shops dedicated to it, with varieties from simple street-stall skewers in hot broth to premium hand-pressed versions. The Samjin Eomuk factory in Yeongdo has been making fish cake since 1953 and has a small museum where you can try making your own. My kids loved that stop more than any other on our last Busan trip.

## When to Visit

**Spring (April-May)** is my favorite time for Busan. Cherry blossoms at Dalmaji Hill and Samnak Ecological Park, comfortable temperatures, and beaches that are pretty but not yet crowded.

**Summer (July-August)** is peak beach season. Haeundae and Gwangalli are packed, festivals happen everywhere, and the city has a buzzing energy. Just be prepared for humidity and occasional typhoon warnings.

**Fall (September-November)** brings crisp air, clear skies, and dramatic temple foliage at Beomeosa Temple. The Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) in October draws film lovers from around the world, and the city takes on a cultural energy that's different from its usual beach vibe.

**Winter (December-February)** is quieter but has its own charm. Busan winters are milder than Seoul — you'll still need a coat, but it rarely drops below freezing. The seafood is at its best in winter, and you can walk the beaches in relative solitude.

## Practical Tips

**Budget three full days minimum.** One for Haeundae/Gwangalli, one for Gamcheon/Nampo-dong/Jagalchi, and one for Seomyeon and wherever else catches your eye. If you have a fourth day, take the Blueline Park sky capsule along the coast from Mipo to Cheongsapo — it's a short ride but the views are worth it.

**The Busan dialect is different.** Busan people speak in satoori (regional dialect) that's louder, more direct, and faster than standard Seoul Korean. Don't be alarmed if people sound a bit rougher — that's just how folks talk here, and it's considered charming, not rude. Even I still get startled sometimes when a Jagalchi ajumma shouts her prices at me.

**Download the Visit Busan Pass app.** It bundles entry fees for major attractions at a discount. Not mandatory, but saves money if you're hitting multiple paid sites.

**Take the train, not a plane.** From Seoul, the KTX is door-to-door faster than flying once you factor in airport time. Plus, watching the Korean countryside roll by for two and a half hours is part of the experience.

**Eat where locals eat.** If a restaurant near a major tourist site has menus only in English and photos of every dish, keep walking. The best food in Busan is in the places where the menu is handwritten on the wall and the ajumma running it looks like she's been there since the market opened.

## More Than Seoul's Little Sister

Busan has spent decades in Seoul's shadow for international tourists, and honestly, that's been fine with the locals. They like their city the way it is — a little rough around the edges, proudly independent, with better seafood and better beaches than anywhere else in the country.

But the secret is getting out. National Geographic named South Korea a top destination for 2026, and Busan is a big part of that story. More direct flights are landing at Gimhae, more foreigners are showing up at Jagalchi, and the city is ready for it — without losing what made it special in the first place.

So if you're planning a Korea trip and thinking about squeezing Busan into a single afternoon, don't. Give it the time it deserves. Walk the beaches, eat the gukbap, get lost in Gamcheon's alleys, and let the salt air and satoori work their way into your memory. Seoul will still be there when you get back. But Busan will be the place you keep thinking about.
