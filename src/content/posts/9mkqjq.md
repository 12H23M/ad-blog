I take the Seoul subway almost every day. Drop my kids off, run errands in Gangnam, meet friends in Hongdae, head to my parents' place in Bundang — it's just how life works here. And honestly? After living in Seoul for over 20 years, I still think this subway system is kind of incredible.

But I also see foreigners standing frozen at ticket machines, looking panicked at transfer stations, or accidentally riding the express train past their stop. I get it. The system is massive — 24 lines, over 650 stations — and the maps look like someone spilled rainbow spaghetti. (And if you want to know which neighborhoods to actually visit, I put together a [Seoul neighborhood guide](/travel/sn9t4c) too.) on a page.

So let me walk you through it the way I'd explain it to a friend visiting for the first time.

## Getting Your Card: T-Money, WOWPASS, and Other Options

First things first. You need a transit card. Technically you can buy single-journey tokens at the machines, but nobody does that. It's slower, costs more per ride, and you'll be fumbling with coins while a line of impatient Koreans forms behind you.

Here's what to get instead:

**T-Money Card** — This is what most Koreans use. You can buy one at any convenience store (CU, GS25, 7-Eleven) for about ₩2,500, then load cash onto it at the store counter or at subway station machines. Tap it when you enter, tap it when you exit. Done. It also works on buses, taxis, and even some vending machines. It's also what you'll tap at [convenience stores](/food/cv7n3k) to pay for your late-night snacks.

**WOWPASS** — If you're a tourist, this might be even better. It's a prepaid card that works as both a transit card and a payment card. You load foreign currency at the WOWPASS kiosks (they're everywhere in tourist areas), and it converts to Korean won at decent rates. My younger son's English teacher uses one and swears by it.

**Apple Pay / Samsung Pay** — Korea has had mobile transit cards for years. If your phone supports it, you can add a T-money card directly to your wallet app. Most Koreans under 30 don't even carry a physical card anymore.

**Single Journey Token** — Available at ticket machines in every station. You pay a ₩500 deposit that you get back when you return the token at the exit. Fine for a one-time ride, but seriously, just get a T-money.

Pro tip: load at least ₩10,000 to start. A single ride is ₩1,550 (with T-money — it's ₩1,650 with a single-journey token), and transfers are free within 30 minutes, so ₩10,000 will last you several days of riding. Oh, and if you're an early bird: rides before 6:30 AM get a 20% discount on the base fare. My husband discovered this on his morning gym commute and won't stop bragging about it.

## Understanding the Lines: Which Ones Actually Matter

Seoul's subway map is intimidating. Take a look:

*Seoul's full subway network — 24 lines, 656+ stations. Don't panic, you won't need most of them. (Source: Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA)*

But here's a secret — as a tourist, you'll probably use about five lines for 90% of your trips.

**Line 1 (Dark Blue)** — The oldest line, running through the old heart of Seoul. Takes you to Seoul Station, City Hall, Jongno (traditional areas), and connects all the way up to Uijeongbu and down to Suwon. Fair warning: this line is crowded and a bit worn. But if you're going to Gwanghwamun or Namdaemun Market, you'll need it.

**Line 2 (Green Circle)** — This is the big one. It's a loop line that circles through all the major areas: Hongdae, Sinchon, Gangnam, Jamsil, Konkuk University, Euljiro. If you only learn one line, make it this one. My older son takes Line 2 to his hagwon, and honestly, half of Seoul's life happens along this loop.

**Line 3 (Orange)** — Connects Gyeongbokgung, Anguk (Bukchon Hanok Village), Apgujeong, and Express Bus Terminal (the huge underground shopping mall). Great for the traditional Seoul + upscale Gangnam combo.

**Line 4 (Light Blue)** — Gets you to Myeongdong (shopping), Dongdaemun (fashion markets), and Seoul Station. Also goes up to Nowon in the north if you're visiting friends in the suburbs like I sometimes do.

**Shinbundang Line (Red)** — The fancy fast one. If you're going to Gangnam from the south side, this line is brand new, super clean, and runs express. It connects Sinsa and Gangnam to Pangyo (Korea's tech hub) and Gwanggyo.

There are plenty more — the Gyeongui-Jungang Line for riverside vibes, Line 7 for Cheongdam and the eastern suburbs, Line 9 for getting to the airport area — but start with the five above and branch out as needed.

## Transfers: They're Free (If You Know the Rules)

This is the part that confuses most visitors. Seoul's transfer system is actually incredibly generous, but it has rules.

**The basics:** When you tap out of the subway and tap onto a bus (or vice versa) within 30 minutes, the transfer is free. You can even transfer between different subway lines without tapping out — you just walk through the transfer corridors inside the station.

**What catches people:** The 30-minute window is tight if you're above ground. If you exit the subway, wander around, grab a coffee, and then try to catch a bus 40 minutes later — that's a new fare. Good news though: between 9 PM and 7 AM, the transfer window extends to 60 minutes, which is nice for late-night outings. But underground transfers between subway lines have no time limit. You could technically walk through the entire underground network of transfer corridors (though I wouldn't recommend it — some of those walks are long enough to count as exercise).

**The distance factor:** Seoul's transit fare is distance-based. Your base fare of ₩1,550 covers 10km, then it's an extra ₩100 per 5km up to 50km, and ₩100 per 8km after that. So if you're going from one end of the city to the other, you might pay ₩1,750-1,850 instead of ₩1,550. Still ridiculously cheap.

**My tip:** When transferring between lines, follow the signs. They're in Korean and English. The number and color of the line you want will be on overhead signs. Walk toward that color. If you see a crowd of people all walking the same direction during rush hour, follow them — they know where they're going.

## The Apps You Need

Paper maps are fine for the big picture, but for actual navigation, you want apps.

**Naver Map** — This is what Koreans use. Not Google Maps (which barely works here for transit). Naver Map gives you exact subway routes, real-time arrival info, exit number recommendations, and even tells you which car to ride for the fastest transfer. It's in English too, though the Korean version has more features.

**KakaoMap** — Naver's competitor. Equally good for transit directions. Some people prefer the interface. I switch between both depending on my mood.

**Subway Korea (지하철)** — A dedicated subway app that shows all lines, real-time train positions, first/last train times, and station facilities. Super handy. My husband has used this app for a decade.

One thing these apps do that's genuinely brilliant: they tell you which door to stand at for the fastest transfer. Like, "Board car 4, door 2, and you'll be right at the Line 3 transfer escalator." This saves so much time during rush hour.

## Seoul Subway Etiquette: The Unspoken Rules

Koreans are generally patient with tourists, but there are some things that'll get you side-eyed:

**Priority seats are sacred.** The seats at the end of each car (usually marked in a different color) are for elderly, pregnant women, and disabled passengers. Even if the car is packed and those seats are empty, most Koreans won't sit there. You shouldn't either. I've seen young Koreans standing for 45 minutes rather than take a priority seat. It's that serious.

**Stand on the right, walk on the left.** This applies to escalators. Stand on the right side, and leave the left side open for people who are walking up. During rush hour, this is not optional.

**Keep your backpack in front.** When it's crowded, swing your backpack to your front or hold it by your feet. Taking up space with a big backpack on your back is the fastest way to annoy an entire subway car of commuters.

**Phone calls are okay, but keep it quiet.** Koreans do talk on the phone in the subway, but they keep it brief and quiet. What you won't see is someone having a 20-minute speakerphone conversation. Please don't be that person.

**Let people exit first.** Wait on both sides of the door, let everyone out, then board. There are actually arrows painted on the platform showing where to stand and where the exit flow goes. Follow them.

**Eating is generally frowned upon.** A bottle of water is fine. Unwrapping a kimbap or cracking open a bag of chips? You'll get looks. Save it for above ground.

## Rush Hour Survival and Pro Tips

Rush hour in Seoul is no joke. We're talking 7:30-9:00 AM and 5:30-7:30 PM. Line 2 during morning rush is basically a competitive sport. Here's how to survive:

**Avoid Line 2 during peak hours if possible.** If your destination is served by another line, take the longer route. Seriously. A 10-minute detour on a less crowded line beats being pressed against strangers for 30 minutes.

**Express trains exist.** Line 9 and the Shinbundang Line have express services that skip smaller stations. These save massive time but can be confusing if you're at a station that the express blows right past. Check the platform signs — they clearly indicate local vs. express.

**First and last train times matter.** The subway runs from about 5:30 AM to midnight. Last trains vary by line and direction, so check the app if you're out late. After midnight, you're looking at taxis or the Night Owl buses (올빼미 버스), which follow major subway routes.

**Station facilities are legit.** Most major stations have convenience stores, bakeries, and sometimes full food courts underground. Express Bus Terminal station has an enormous underground shopping mall. Jamsil connects directly to Lotte World. Some stations have heated floors in winter. It's honestly a whole underground city.

**Coin lockers are available** at major stations like Seoul Station, Hongdae, and Myeongdong. Prices range from ₩1,000-4,000 depending on size. Perfect for dumping your bags while you explore.

**Free WiFi everywhere.** Seoul Metro provides free WiFi on trains and in stations. It's not blazing fast, but it works for messaging and basic browsing. Connect to "Metro_Free_WiFi" or your carrier's network.

## Getting to the Airports

Since every tourist needs this info:

**Incheon Airport (ICN):** Take the AREX (Airport Railroad Express) from Seoul Station. The express train takes 43 minutes and costs ₩11,000. The all-stop version takes about 58 minutes but only ₩4,850. Both use your T-money card. You can also catch the AREX from Hongdae, Digital Media City, and a few other stations.

**Gimpo Airport (GMP):** Much closer to the city. Lines 5, 9, and the AREX all serve Gimpo Airport station. From Hongdae, you're there in 15 minutes on Line 9.

My recommendation: give yourself at least 2 hours for Incheon (the airport is huge and far), and about 1.5 hours for Gimpo.

## One Last Thing

Seoul's subway might look complicated on the map, but once you're in it, everything just makes sense. The signs are bilingual, the announcements are in Korean, English, Chinese, and Japanese, and the system is clean, safe, and almost always on time. I let my sons ride it alone starting in middle school — that's how safe it is.

Download Naver Map, grab a T-money card, and just go. You'll figure it out faster than you think. And if you get lost? Just exit at any station, look around, grab a coffee, and try again. Half the fun of Seoul is what you find when you accidentally end up somewhere new.

Trust me. After a couple of rides, you'll wonder why every city doesn't have a subway system like this.
