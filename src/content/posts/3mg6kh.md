A few years ago, my older son's American English teacher came over for dinner. She'd been living in Seoul for about six months, and her Korean was getting pretty decent. At one point, she turned to my mother-in-law and said, "밥 먹었어?" (Did you eat?). Just like that. Pure banmal. To a 70-year-old woman she'd just met.

My mother-in-law's chopsticks froze mid-air. My husband suddenly became very interested in his soup. And I had to gently explain later that what she said was the grammatical equivalent of walking up to someone's grandmother and going, "Yo, you eat yet?"

She wasn't being rude on purpose. She just didn't know. And honestly, Korean speech levels are the single hardest thing about our language for foreigners to wrap their heads around. So let me break it all down for you.

## The Basics: Korean Has Seven Speech Levels (But You Only Need Four)

Korean technically has seven different speech levels, each with its own verb endings. That sounds terrifying, but here's the good news: only four of them are actually used in modern daily life. The other three are basically museum pieces.

**The four you need to know:**

**하십시오체 (Hasipsio-che)** — The formal polite level. This is what news anchors use, what you hear in business presentations, and what customer service reps say on the phone. Verb endings like "-습니다" and "-ㅂ니다." When you hear "감사합니다" (thank you), that's this level.

**해요체 (Haeyo-che)** — The informal polite level. This is your everyday workhorse. You use this with strangers, acquaintances, coworkers, people older than you, basically anyone you want to be polite to without sounding like a news anchor. Verb endings in "-요." When you say "안녕하세요" (hello), that's this level. If you learn one speech level, learn this one.

**해라체 (Haera-che)** — The plain level. You'll see this in newspapers, books, and academic writing more than in conversation. It's also used in certain spoken contexts between close friends or when quoting someone.

**해체 (Hae-che)** — The casual level, better known as 반말 (banmal). This is what you use with close friends, younger people, kids, and pets. No "-요" at the end. "안녕" instead of "안녕하세요." "먹어" instead of "먹어요." Simple, casual, and loaded with social meaning.

The three extinct-ish levels? 하소서체 was used for talking to royalty. 하오체 and 하게체 were somewhere in between but have mostly disappeared. You might hear 하오체 from an old man in a Jeolla province village, or in a historical drama. That's about it.

## 존댓말 vs 반말: The Big Divide

Everything in Korean conversation comes down to one question: 존댓말 or 반말?

**존댓말** (jondaenmal) means "respectful speech." It covers the polite levels — 하십시오체 and 해요체. You use it with anyone older, anyone you've just met, anyone in a position above you, and generally anyone you're not extremely close to.

**반말** literally means "half speech." You're cutting off the respectful parts. Drop the "-요," shorten the verbs, skip the formal endings. It's intimate, casual, and familiar. You use it with close friends who are your age, younger people, children, and your pets. My dog only gets banmal. She doesn't seem to mind.

Here's what trips up foreigners: banmal isn't just "casual." Using it with the wrong person isn't like accidentally saying "dude" to your boss in English. It's more like walking into a stranger's house with your shoes on and putting your feet on their table. The social weight is enormous.

Using banmal to someone older or to a stranger can feel like you're declaring them beneath you. In extreme cases, people have gotten into real physical fights over uninvited banmal. There have been news stories. It's that serious.

## Why Koreans Ask Your Age Within Five Minutes of Meeting You

If you've spent any time in Korea, you've probably been asked this question almost immediately: "나이가 어떻게 되세요?" (How old are you?). Foreigners sometimes find this nosy or intrusive, but it's not personal curiosity. It's practical necessity.

Until we know your age, we literally don't know how to talk to you. Age determines which speech level to use, which titles to apply, which verb endings to choose, and how the entire relationship dynamic works. Even a single year of age difference can change everything.

Think about it this way. In English, you address your 30-year-old coworker and your 30-year-old friend pretty much the same way. Same pronouns, same sentence structure. In Korean, the language itself shifts depending on who you're talking to, who you're talking about, and where you stand in relation to them.

There are different levels of formality even for asking the age question itself:

- "연세가 어떻게 되세요?" — Very formal, for someone clearly much older than you
- "나이가 어떻게 되세요?" — Standard polite, the most common version
- "몇 살이에요?" — Slightly less formal, acceptable with peers
- "몇 년생이세요?" — "What year were you born?" — very popular among young Koreans
- "몇 살이야?" — Casual banmal, only for someone clearly much younger. Using this on a stranger your age would be rude.

One important note: if someone is clearly 20 or 30 years older than you, don't ask their age at all. Just use the most respectful speech you can. Asking their age implies you think they might be close to yours. My mother-in-law would not appreciate that.

## The Speech Level Switchover: 반말하자

One of the most interesting Korean social rituals happens when two people decide to switch from 존댓말 to 반말. It doesn't just happen. You have to ask.

The older person (or in same-age situations, either person) initiates with something like:

- "반말해도 돼요?" — Can I speak casually?
- "말 편하게 해요" — Let's speak comfortably
- "우리 말 놓을까요?" — Shall we drop the formalities?

Getting invited to switch to banmal is a genuine social milestone. It means the person considers you close enough to lower the wall. It's acceptance. Warmth. When a Korean friend tells you "반말하자" (let's use banmal), it feels like crossing a threshold in the friendship.

Refusing to switch — continuing to use 존댓말 after being invited to drop it — signals that you want to keep your distance. It's not rude exactly, but it's noticeable. In K-dramas, the moment a character switches from 존댓말 to 반말 is often a dramatic pivot point. Audiences gasp. That's how much weight it carries.

When I started dating my husband in college, we used 존댓말 for the first few weeks. The day he said "말 놓을까?" was basically our unofficial "this is getting serious" moment. My older son would probably roll his eyes if he heard this. But that's how it works.

## It's Not Just About the Listener — Honorifics Go Deeper

Here's something that really confuses Korean learners: speech levels aren't just about who you're talking to. They're also about who you're talking about.

Let's say you're chatting casually with your close friend (banmal is fine between you). But then you mention your friend's grandmother. Even though you're speaking banmal to your friend, you need to use honorific verbs when referring to the grandmother. You can't say "할머니가 밥 먹었어" (Grandma ate rice). You need "할머니가 진지를 드셨어" — using the honorific verb 드시다 instead of 먹다, and the honorific noun 진지 instead of 밥.

Korean has an entire parallel vocabulary for this:

| Regular | Honorific | Meaning |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 먹다 | 드시다 | to eat |
| 자다 | 주무시다 | to sleep |
| 있다 | 계시다 | to be (location) |
| 말하다 | 말씀하시다 | to speak |
| 죽다 | 돌아가시다 | to pass away |
| 밥 | 진지 | rice/meal |
| 나이 | 연세 | age |
| 집 | 댁 | house/home |

And it works the other direction too. When talking about yourself to someone respected, you humble yourself. "나" (I) becomes "저." "우리" (we) becomes "저희." Instead of "말하겠습니다" (I will speak), you say "말씀드리겠습니다" — a self-lowering form.

The whole system runs on two tracks simultaneously: elevate the other person, humble yourself.

## Family Words That Everyone Uses (Even for Non-Family)

Korean has specific words for older brother, older sister, younger sibling — and they change depending on the speaker's gender. What really catches foreigners off guard is that Koreans use these family terms for non-family members too.

**If you're female:**
- 오빠 (oppa) — what you call an older male (brother, older male friend, boyfriend)
- 언니 (eonni) — what you call an older female (sister, older female friend)

**If you're male:**
- 형 (hyeong) — what you call an older male (brother, older male friend)
- 누나 (nuna) — what you call an older female (sister, older female friend)

Calling an older friend by their first name without one of these titles is rude. If my older son's friend is two years older, my son calls him 형 (hyung), not by his name. This extends to pretty much all social relationships. Your university senior is 선배 (seonbae). A coworker who joined before you is also 선배.

Then there's the whole romantic dimension. 오빠 is what women call their boyfriends. My younger sister calls her husband 오빠 after 15 years of marriage. 누나 is what younger guys call their older girlfriends. Context is everything.

For strangers, we use 아저씨 (ajeossi, "mister") for middle-aged men and 아줌마 (ajumma) for middle-aged women. Fair warning: calling a woman 아줌마 when she doesn't think she's that old will not go well. Restaurant servers often get called 이모 (imo, meaning "aunt") instead — it's softer and friendlier. I've been called both. I prefer 이모.

## The Workplace: Where Speech Levels Get Really Specific

Korean offices run on a strict title hierarchy, and you address people by their title plus 님 (nim, an honorific suffix), never by name.

The corporate ladder, from top to bottom:

- 회장님 — Chairman
- 사장님 — CEO/President
- 부장님 — Department Head
- 차장님 — Deputy Head
- 과장님 — Section Chief
- 대리님 — Assistant Manager
- 팀장님 — Team Leader
- 사원 — Staff (entry level)

You never call your department head "김부장" (Kim Bujang) without the 님. It's always "김부장님." And when addressing them directly, you often drop the surname and just say "부장님."

In meetings and presentations, everything goes to the formal level (하십시오체). "보고 드리겠습니다" (I will report to you). In everyday office conversation, it relaxes to 해요체. But banmal with your boss? Only if they've explicitly said it's okay, and even then, most people keep at least some level of formality.

For coworkers at the same level, you might use 씨 (ssi) after their name: "수진 씨" (Sujin-ssi). But never put 씨 after just a surname. "김 씨" sounds dismissive, like you're reducing someone to their family name. Always use the full name or given name with 씨.

Some younger companies are experimenting with flat structures and English names to escape all of this. But in my husband's company, which is a mid-sized firm, the title system is very much alive.

## Mistakes That Will Make Koreans Wince

I've watched enough foreign friends navigate Korean to compile a greatest hits of common mistakes:

**Using banmal with someone you just met.** This is number one. Even if you're the same age, you don't jump straight to banmal. You negotiate it. Starting with banmal says "I don't respect you enough to bother with formality."

**Saying "안녕" to someone who deserves "안녕하세요."** Casual greetings to elders or superiors are jarring. It's like greeting your company's CEO with "Sup."

**Using plain verbs when talking about someone's elders.** If you're talking about your friend's parents, use honorific verbs. Even in casual conversation. Saying "어머니가 왔어" (Your mom came) instead of "어머니가 오셨어" (Your mom came — honorific) is disrespectful to the mother, not to your friend.

**Being too formal when warmth is expected.** Over-formality with people who consider you close can actually feel cold. If a friend's mom has known you for years and you're still speaking in 하십시오체, she might feel you're keeping her at arm's length. 해요체 is appropriate.

**Dropping subjects like Korean speakers do, but at the wrong times.** Korean drops the subject when it's obvious from context. Saying "저는" (I) at the start of every sentence sounds robotic. But dropping it when the subject is ambiguous creates confusion.

## How Things Are Changing (Slowly)

Korean speech levels aren't static. They're shifting, especially with younger generations.

My kids' generation is more flexible with honorifics among friends. They question rigid hierarchy more openly than we ever did. Some younger Koreans argue that the 존댓말/반말 system reinforces inequality and doesn't build genuine relationships.

Social media has accelerated casual speech. Texting is almost always more casual than face-to-face conversation. My older son texts his school seniors in a way that would have gotten me a lecture when I was his age.

There's even a growing trend of children using banmal with their parents. When my younger son drops his 요 endings with me, I let it slide sometimes. My mother-in-law is horrified. "In my day," she says, and then I stop listening because I know what comes next.

Korea also reformed its age counting system in 2023, switching from the traditional Korean age to international age for legal purposes. One goal was to reduce confusion in situations where speech levels depend on age differences within the same school year.

But the core system isn't going anywhere. The language itself is built around these levels. You can't conjugate a Korean verb without choosing a speech level. It's baked into every sentence. What's changing is how rigidly people enforce the rules, not whether the rules exist.

## Regional Flavor: Dialects Add Another Layer

If you travel outside Seoul, speech levels get another twist: regional dialects.

**Gyeongsang dialect** (Busan, Daegu) sounds harsh and direct even when people are being perfectly polite. The intonation is stronger, with pitch accents that don't exist in standard Korean. Instead of the standard polite ending "-세요," you'll hear "-이소." The famous Jagalchi Market sign reads "오이소, 보이소, 사이소" — come, see, buy — all in Busan dialect.

**Jeolla dialect** (Gwangju, southwestern Korea) is softer and slower. Sentences often trail off with particles like "잉" — think of it as the Korean equivalent of the Canadian "eh." Interestingly, the old 하오체 speech level that's died out in Seoul still survives in some Jeolla dialect speakers.

**Jeju dialect** is so different from standard Korean that linguists sometimes classify it as a separate language entirely. The honorific system uses different endings, and older Jeju speakers can sound quite blunt to mainlanders.

**Chungcheong dialect** is known for its drawn-out, gentle pace. People from Chungcheong are stereotyped as easygoing and unhurried, and their speech pattern reflects it.

For most foreigners learning Korean, standard Seoul Korean is the way to go. But if you end up living in Busan and pick up some 경상도 사투리, locals will love you for it.

## The Bottom Line: Just Add -요 and You'll Be Fine

If all of this sounds overwhelming, here's my honest advice as someone who's been speaking this language for over 40 years: when in doubt, use 해요체. Add "-요" to the end of things. Say "안녕하세요" instead of "안녕." Say "감사합니다" instead of "고마워." Be a little more formal than you think necessary.

Koreans are genuinely forgiving when foreigners make speech level mistakes. We know it's hard. When my older son's American teacher used banmal with my mother-in-law, we corrected her gently and moved on. My mother-in-law even laughed about it later (much later). The effort to speak Korean at all earns you enormous goodwill.

But understanding how speech levels work gives you more than just grammatical accuracy. It gives you a window into how Korean society operates — the respect for elders, the importance of relationships, the way closeness is earned through small linguistic negotiations. Every "-요" you add isn't just grammar. It's a gesture of respect. And every time someone tells you "반말하자," it's an invitation into their inner circle.

That, to me, is the most beautiful thing about Korean speech levels. They don't just communicate information. They communicate relationships.
