Friday night in our house means one thing — someone's opening the Baemin app. My husband wants fried chicken. My older son wants pizza. My younger son wants tteokbokki. I want jokbal. We negotiate for about ten minutes, someone suggests we just order from two places, and then we end up ordering from three. This is a completely normal Friday in Korea.

Delivery culture here isn't just a convenience — it's woven into daily life in a way that surprises most foreigners. We don't just order when we're too tired to cook. We order because it's Tuesday afternoon and someone wants a single iced Americano delivered to the office. We order jjajangmyeon on moving day because that's tradition. We order chicken and beer at a park by the river because there's a delivery rider who will bring it to the exact bench you're sitting on.

If you're visiting Korea or just moved here, understanding delivery culture will change your daily life. Let me walk you through it.

## Why Koreans Order Delivery for Everything

Korea's delivery market is one of the largest in the world — worth well over $10 billion annually. The country has roughly 130,000 restaurants on delivery platforms, and in cities like Seoul, you can get almost anything delivered in 20 to 40 minutes. Not an hour. Not "sometime this evening." Twenty minutes.

The infrastructure that makes this possible has been building for decades. Long before apps existed, Korea had a delivery culture. Chinese-Korean restaurants have been delivering jjajangmyeon on motorcycles since the 1960s and 70s. They'd bring the food in real porcelain bowls, and you'd leave the dirty dishes outside your door. A rider would come back later to collect them. This still happens — if you order from a traditional Chinese restaurant today, you might get proper bowls instead of disposable containers.

What the apps did was take this existing culture and supercharge it. Now, instead of calling a restaurant and explaining where you live (which was always a pain for foreigners), you tap a few buttons and a GPS pin does the rest. The barrier to ordering dropped to zero, and the variety exploded.

Here's what you can get delivered in Korea beyond regular restaurant food:

- **Convenience store items** — snacks, drinks, ramen, even soju
- **Coffee** — yes, a single iced Americano to your apartment
- **Groceries** — fresh produce, meat, eggs, arriving within an hour
- **Pharmacy items** — through certain apps
- **Late-night food** — many restaurants deliver until 2 or 3 AM

My husband once ordered a single bottle of water through Baemin at 11 PM because we'd run out and neither of us wanted to go downstairs. The delivery fee was 1,000 won. The water was 800 won. He felt no shame. This is Korea.

## The Apps: Baemin vs Yogiyo vs Coupang Eats

Three main apps dominate the delivery landscape. Each has a personality.

### Baemin (배달의민족)

Baemin — short for Baedal Minjok, which playfully translates to "Nation of Delivery" — is the biggest player. It's the one most Koreans open first. The app is known for its quirky branding, distinctive mint-green color, and custom font that you'll see on merchandise all over Korea. Baemin isn't just a delivery app; it's become a cultural brand. They sell socks, stationery, and even furniture with their logo. It's bizarre and charming.

**What makes it good:**
- Largest restaurant selection
- Clean interface with great photos
- "Baemin 1" option for single-rider express delivery (faster but slightly more expensive)
- Regular promotions and coupons
- Baemin Store for grocery and convenience store items

**Typical delivery fee:** 0 to 4,000 won depending on distance and whether the restaurant offers free delivery. Baemin 1 orders usually have a set delivery fee around 2,000 to 3,500 won.

### Yogiyo (요기요)

Yogiyo was Baemin's main competitor for years. It's simpler, slightly more straightforward, and sometimes has restaurant options that Baemin doesn't — especially older, smaller places that signed up with Yogiyo first. The interface isn't as flashy, but it works. Think of it as the reliable second option.

**What makes it good:**
- Sometimes exclusive restaurants not on Baemin
- Straightforward ordering process
- Good for finding local neighborhood restaurants
- Occasional aggressive discount promotions

### Coupang Eats (쿠팡이츠)

Coupang Eats is the newest of the three, backed by Coupang — Korea's answer to Amazon. They entered the delivery game hard and fast, burning through subsidies to grab market share. Their big selling point is speed and the "Wow" membership discount (if you're already a Coupang Wow subscriber, which many Koreans are for the free shipping on regular Coupang orders).

**What makes it good:**
- Fast delivery times
- Coupang Wow member discounts
- Clean, modern app design
- Good tracking with real-time rider location

**The honest truth:** Most Korean households use all three. I have all three installed. We check Baemin first, compare prices and delivery times on Coupang Eats, and occasionally find that one specific restaurant we want is only on Yogiyo. It's like having multiple streaming services — annoying but inevitable.

## How to Order Step-by-Step (Even Without Korean)

Here's the thing that terrifies most foreigners: these apps are primarily in Korean. Baemin has made some progress with English support, but it's limited. Don't let that stop you. The ordering process is visual enough that you can figure it out, and I'll walk you through it.

### Setting Up

1. **Download the app** — Search "배달의민족" or "Baemin" in your app store
2. **Register** — You'll need a Korean phone number. This is the hardest part for tourists. If you have a Korean SIM or eSIM with a local number, you're set. If not, ask your hotel or Airbnb host if they can help you order.
3. **Set your address** — The app uses GPS, but you should also input your address manually for accuracy. Korean addresses can be confusing — the key information is your 동 (dong, neighborhood), building name, and apartment number.

### Placing an Order

Once you're in the app, the flow is pretty intuitive:

1. **Browse categories** — You'll see icons for chicken (치킨), pizza (피자), Korean food (한식), Chinese food (중식), Japanese food (일식), snacks (분식), and more. The pictures help even if you can't read Korean.
2. **Pick a restaurant** — Restaurants show their minimum order amount (최소주문), delivery fee (배달비), estimated time, and star rating. Photos of the food are usually accurate in Korea — what you see is genuinely what you get.
3. **Select items** — Tap on dishes, choose options (size, spice level, add-ons). Many listings have photos.
4. **Checkout** — Review your order, apply any coupons, choose payment (card or cash on delivery — yes, cash is still an option).
5. **Track** — Watch the little motorcycle icon move toward your location. It's weirdly satisfying.

### Tips for Non-Korean Speakers

- **Screenshot translate** — Use your phone's built-in translate feature (Google Lens or Apple's Live Text) to translate menu items in real time
- **Learn key food words** — 치킨 (chicken), 피자 (pizza), 짜장면 (jjajangmyeon), 떡볶이 (tteokbokki), 족발 (jokbal)
- **Look for pictures** — Most restaurants upload photos of every dish
- **Check the star rating** — Anything above 4.5 with more than 100 reviews is usually a safe bet
- **Minimum order amounts** — Many restaurants require a minimum (usually 12,000 to 18,000 won). If you're ordering alone, this is sometimes a challenge. Baemin 1 often has lower or no minimums.

### Payment

Most Koreans pay by card through the app. International credit cards sometimes work, sometimes don't. If yours doesn't, you have options:

- **Cash on delivery (현금)** — Select this at checkout. Have exact change ready.
- **Kakao Pay** — If you've set up a Kakao account, this often works where international cards fail
- **Prepaid cards** — Some convenience stores sell prepaid Visa cards that work with delivery apps

## What to Order First (Our Family Favorites)

If you're new to Korean delivery, here's where to start. These are the dishes Koreans order most, and they travel well — meaning they taste just as good when they arrive at your door.

### Fried Chicken (치킨)

Korean fried chicken is the king of delivery food. It's what Koreans order to celebrate, to commiserate, to watch a baseball game, or because it's any day ending in a day. The chicken arrives hot, crispy, and usually with pickled radish (치킨무) on the side.

**Must-try styles:**
- **양념치킨** (yangnyeom) — Sweet and spicy glazed. The classic.
- **간장치킨** (ganjang) — Soy garlic. My personal favorite.
- **후라이드** (fried) — Plain crispy. Sometimes simple is best.
- **반반** (banban) — Half and half. Can't decide? Get two flavors in one order. This is what we always do.

Big chains like **BBQ Chicken, BHC, Kyochon,** and **Puradak** are all reliable. Every Korean has their loyal brand. Arguments about which chicken chain is best have ended friendships. I'm exaggerating. Slightly.

### Jjajangmyeon (짜장면)

Black bean noodles from Chinese-Korean restaurants. This is THE moving-day food in Korea — it's tradition to order jjajangmyeon when you move into a new place. The noodles are chewy, the black bean sauce is savory and slightly sweet, and it costs around 6,000 to 8,000 won. Usually comes with tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork) if you're ordering for a group, and you should, because tangsuyuk is incredible.

### Tteokbokki (떡볶이)

Spicy rice cakes, often ordered as part of a set that includes fried foods (튀김), sundae (Korean blood sausage), and fish cakes. This is classic comfort food. My younger son's go-to order after a tough day at school. Sets usually run 15,000 to 20,000 won and easily feed two or three people.

### Jokbal (족발)

Braised pig's feet, sliced thin and served with salted shrimp sauce and lettuce wraps. This is premium delivery food — a large order runs 35,000 to 45,000 won. It's what you order when friends come over. The meat is tender, slightly sweet, and pairs absurdly well with soju. Late-night jokbal delivery is a Korean institution.

### Pizza

Korean pizza deserves its own paragraph because it is not what you expect. Korean pizza chains like **Domino's Korea, Pizza Hut Korea, Mr. Pizza,** and **Pizza Alvolo** offer toppings that would start arguments in Italy. Sweet potato mousse on the crust. Bulgogi pizza. Shrimp and corn. Honey drizzled on everything. My older son loves the sweet potato crust pizza from Domino's, which has a ring of sweet potato filling baked into the edge. It sounds wrong. It works.

### Bossam (보쌈)

Steamed pork belly wrapped in napa cabbage or perilla leaves with various accompaniments — kimchi, garlic, ssamjang (dipping paste). Similar vibe to jokbal but a different preparation. Perfect delivery food because it arrives ready to wrap and eat. No cooking, no reheating, just lay it all out on the table and go.

## The Unwritten Rules

Delivery in Korea comes with its own etiquette, and knowing these will make your life smoother.

**Leave your door unlocked or be ready.** Delivery riders are fast. They'll buzz your intercom, ride the elevator up, and expect to hand off the food quickly. They have dozens of deliveries to make. Don't make them wait.

**Dispose of packaging properly.** Korean recycling rules are strict. Separate the plastic containers from the paper bags from the food waste. Your neighbors will judge you if you dump everything in one bag. If you got real dishes from a Chinese restaurant, rinse them and leave them outside your door in the bag they came in.

**Tip culture doesn't really exist.** Unlike the US, tipping delivery riders isn't standard in Korea. Some apps have recently added a tipping option, and a small tip (1,000 to 2,000 won) is appreciated but never expected. The delivery fee already compensates the rider.

**Minimum order amounts are real.** If a restaurant says 15,000 won minimum, you can't order a 7,000 won dish alone. Either add more items or use Baemin 1, which sometimes waives minimums in exchange for a delivery fee.

**Late-night delivery is normal.** Ordering food at midnight is not considered weird here. Many restaurants, especially chicken places and jokbal joints, deliver until 1, 2, or even 3 AM. Nobody will judge you. Night owl culture is strong in Korea.

**Rainy day surcharges happen.** When it rains heavily, delivery demand spikes and rider supply drops. Some platforms add a small weather surcharge, and delivery times get longer. Koreans have a saying: "비 오는 날엔 전 부쳐 먹어야지" — on rainy days, you have to eat jeon (Korean pancakes). But since many people order jeon delivery on rainy days, the wait can be brutal.

## Beyond Food: Delivery for Everything

Korea's delivery obsession extends well beyond restaurant food.

**Grocery delivery** has exploded. **Coupang Rocket Fresh** and **Market Kurly** (마켓컬리) deliver fresh groceries, often with same-day or dawn delivery — order before midnight, and your groceries are at your door by 7 AM. I use Market Kurly for produce and specialty items. The quality control is impressive; they'll replace bruised fruit without question.

**Convenience store delivery** through apps like Baemin Store or GS25's own app means you can get ramen, ice cream, or a phone charger delivered in 20 minutes.

**Laundry pickup and delivery** services will collect your dirty clothes and return them cleaned and folded. Not something every foreigner knows about, but incredibly useful if you're staying somewhere without good laundry facilities.

The whole system runs on an incredible logistics network of motorcycle riders navigating Korean traffic at speeds that would terrify most people. Those riders are everywhere — weaving between cars, hauling insulated delivery bags on their backs, keeping the nation fed around the clock.

## A Final Thought

When my husband and I were first married, ordering delivery meant calling a restaurant, stammering through our address, and hoping for the best. Now my kids order dinner from their phones faster than I can decide what I want. The technology changed, but the impulse didn't. Koreans have always loved the idea of good food showing up at the door.

If there's one thing that captures everyday Korean life better than K-dramas or K-pop, it's this: a family sitting on the living room floor on a Friday night, containers spread out on the table, arguing over the last piece of fried chicken, with a K-drama playing on the TV that nobody's really watching because the food is too good.
