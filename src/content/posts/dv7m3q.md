Picture this. You're sitting cross-legged on the floor of a pojangmacha — one of those orange tent bars tucked under a highway overpass in Seoul. The plastic table is covered with plates of odeng and tteokbokki. A stranger you met twenty minutes ago is filling your shot glass with soju, and somehow you're already telling them about your childhood dog. That's Korean drinking culture in a nutshell. It breaks down walls faster than anything else in this country.

Korea has one of the most distinctive drinking cultures on the planet. It's not just about what people drink or how much — though Koreans do drink a lot — it's about the rituals, the rules, the food, and the way alcohol weaves itself into nearly every social situation. Whether you're joining coworkers for a hoesik, sharing makgeolli with friends on a rainy afternoon, or grabbing a beer at a convenience store at midnight, understanding how Koreans drink will teach you more about this culture than a dozen museum visits.

## The Drinks: What Korea Is Actually Pouring

Let's start with the obvious one.

**Soju (소주)** is the backbone of Korean drinking. It's a clear spirit, typically between 16 and 20 percent alcohol, sold in those iconic green bottles that litter every restaurant table in the country. A bottle costs around 1,800 won at a convenience store — that's roughly a dollar fifty. At a restaurant, maybe 4,000 or 5,000 won. It's absurdly cheap, and that accessibility is a big part of why soju is everywhere.

The dominant brand is Jinro Chamisul, which controls over half the domestic market. But regional loyalties run deep. In Busan, people drink C1. In the south, it's Good Day by Muhak. Ask someone from Daegu to drink a Seoul brand and you might get a look. Flavor-wise, traditional soju is clean and slightly sweet with a sharp finish. Not everyone loves it neat, which is why the flavored soju explosion happened. Peach, strawberry, green grape, grapefruit, yogurt — the fruit-flavored bottles sit at around 12 to 14 percent ABV and have become massively popular, especially with younger drinkers and foreigners finding their way in.

**Makgeolli (막걸리)** is Korea's oldest alcohol, and it's having a serious comeback. This milky, slightly fizzy rice wine sits at about 6 to 9 percent alcohol and tastes tangy and sweet in a way that sneaks up on you. Farmers used to drink it in the fields. Now you'll find artisanal makgeolli bars in Ikseon-dong pouring it from ceramic bowls alongside cheese platters. The unpasteurized version — saeng makgeolli — has a shorter shelf life but a livelier, more complex taste that's worth seeking out.

**Beer** in Korea used to mean exactly two things: Cass or Hite. Both are light, inoffensive lagers that exist mainly to wash down fried chicken. But the craft beer scene has exploded in the last few years. Seoul alone has dozens of microbreweries, with hotspots in Itaewon, Euljiro, and Gangnam. Magpie Brewing Co. was one of the pioneers. The market is growing at over 8 percent annually, and the government has actually relaxed regulations to help smaller breweries get off the ground.

Then there's **somaek (소맥)** — the cocktail that might define Korean drinking more than any single beverage. You take a glass of beer, drop a shot glass of soju into it, and drink the whole thing. The ratio is usually 7 parts beer to 3 parts soju, but everyone has their own formula. There's a whole ritual around it: someone stirs the mix with chopsticks, another person slams the table to make it fizz, and everyone cheers. It sounds chaotic because it is.

You'll also encounter **cheongju** (clear rice wine, the refined cousin of makgeolli), **bokbunja-ju** (raspberry wine), and a growing number of craft sojus made from traditional Joseon Dynasty recipes. The Korean alcohol scene is in the middle of a genuine revival, with government subsidies helping small distilleries bring centuries-old beverages back to life.

## The Rules: Korean Drinking Etiquette That Actually Matters

Korean drinking comes with a set of unspoken rules that are very much spoken about if you break them. Most of these trace back to Confucian values around respect, hierarchy, and social harmony. You don't need to memorize every detail, but knowing the big ones will save you from some genuinely awkward moments.

**Never pour your own drink.** This is the cardinal rule. You wait for someone else to fill your glass, and you do the same for them. If your neighbor's glass is empty, that's your cue. Letting someone sit with an empty glass is almost rude. The constant back-and-forth of pouring creates a rhythm to the evening — it's what keeps the conversation flowing and the connection building.

**Use two hands.** When you pour for someone, hold the bottle with your right hand and support your right wrist or forearm with your left hand. When someone pours for you, receive the glass the same way — both hands. With close friends your own age, nobody cares. But with anyone older or senior to you, two hands is non-negotiable.

**Turn your head when drinking with elders.** If someone older pours you a drink, you accept it with both hands, then turn your body slightly to the side when you take the sip. You cover the glass with your free hand. It's a gesture of deference, showing that you're not boldly drinking face-to-face with someone you respect. The first drink from an elder should be finished in one shot.

**Don't refuse the first glass.** Someone offers you a drink, especially someone older — you accept. Even if you're not a big drinker, taking that first glass is a sign of respect and willingness to participate. After that, a polite decline is more acceptable. Saying you can't drink for health reasons works better than saying you just don't feel like it.

**Wait for empty glasses.** Don't top someone off when their glass is still half full. In Korean drinking culture, you refill when the glass is empty. This is different from, say, Japanese custom where you might keep topping up. Watch the glasses around you, and when they're drained, offer to pour.

There's also the ritual of **opening a soju bottle**. You'll see Koreans shake the bottle, then flick the bottom of it with their palm. Some people twist the cap and use the loose metal ring to play a mini-game — trying to flick it off with one finger. It's playful and it's everywhere.

## Anju: The Food You Never Drink Without

Here's something that catches a lot of foreigners off guard: Koreans almost never drink without eating. The concept of sitting at a bar nursing a cocktail with nothing but a bowl of peanuts is basically foreign here. When you drink in Korea, you eat. The food you eat while drinking is called anju (안주), and it's not an afterthought — it's half the experience.

The word itself is telling. Anju literally means "press down the alcohol," and the tradition goes back to Joseon Dynasty taverns where food was included with your drink order. Today, every drinking establishment from a high-end whiskey bar to a plastic-chair pocha serves anju, and the pairing of drink to food follows its own logic.

**Soju pairs with bold, savory flavors.** Think samgyeopsal sizzling on a tabletop grill, a bubbling pot of kimchi jjigae, or jokbal — braised pig's feet glazed in soy sauce and sliced paper-thin. The richness of the food tempers soju's sharpness. Spicy dishes work especially well — there's a reason tteokbokki and golbaengi muchim (spicy sea snail salad) are classic soju companions.

**Beer goes with fried food.** The pairing of Korean fried chicken and beer is so iconic it has its own word: 치맥 (chimaek, chicken + maekju). People order entire platters of crispy, sauce-coated chicken and sit by the Han River with cans of beer on warm summer nights. It's practically a national pastime.

**Makgeolli belongs with pajeon.** There's a saying in Korea: when it rains, you eat pajeon and drink makgeolli. The crispy, savory scallion pancake and the tangy rice wine are one of those pairings that just works at some almost primal level. Walk into any traditional makgeolli bar and pajeon will be the first thing on the menu.

Other popular anju includes corn cheese (buttery corn baked with mozzarella), dubu kimchi (tofu with stir-fried kimchi and pork), dried squid with gochujang mayo, and dakbal — spicy chicken feet that require both courage and a high spice tolerance.

## Where Koreans Drink: From Tents to Convenience Stores

The setting matters as much as the drink in Korea, and you'll find people drinking in places that might surprise you.

**Pojangmacha** are the orange tent bars you see on streets and under bridges, especially at night. They serve cheap soju, beer, and hearty anju like odeng (fish cake skewers in hot broth) and sundae (Korean blood sausage). The atmosphere is cramped, smoky, and wonderful. Strangers talk to each other. The ajumma running the place might yell at you to eat more. It's unfiltered Seoul at its best, though the tents are slowly disappearing as the city modernizes.

**Hof (호프)** is the Korean bar term for a beer-focused spot, borrowed from the German word. These range from no-frills basement joints with sticky tables to trendy craft beer lounges. The food tends to be beer-friendly — fries, sausage platters, dried snacks.

**Convenience stores** have become legitimate drinking destinations, especially for younger Koreans. CU, GS25, and 7-Eleven all have outdoor seating where groups gather with 1,800-won soju bottles and instant ramyeon from the store's hot water dispenser. It's cheap, it's casual, and there's zero pretense.

And then there's **noraebang (노래방)**, the karaoke room that serves as the second or third stop on any proper Korean drinking night. You rent a private room, order more drinks, and sing your lungs out with your friends or colleagues. It's not optional. If you survive a hoesik dinner and the group heads to noraebang, you're going. The song selection usually starts sentimental and ends chaotic.

## Korean Drinking Games: How Drinking Becomes a Sport

Korean drinking isn't a quiet affair. There are games, and they are taken seriously — at least until nobody can keep track of the rules anymore.

**The soju cap game** is a classic. After opening a bottle, someone twists the metal strip from the cap into a tight coil. Players take turns flicking it with their finger. Whoever finally flicks it off doesn't drink — everyone else does. Or the person who breaks it off drinks. Rules vary by table.

**Baskin Robbins 31** is dead simple and deadly effective. Players take turns counting up from one, saying one, two, or three numbers at a time. Whoever is forced to say "31" takes a shot. The strategy is real. The results are predictable.

**The image game** involves someone asking "who at this table is most likely to..." followed by something like "fall asleep at their desk" or "date a celebrity." Everyone points at their answer on the count of three. The person with the most fingers pointed at them drinks.

**Nunchi game** is pure chaos. Someone yells "nunchi game!" and players have to stand up one at a time shouting a number in sequence — "one!" "two!" "three!" If two people stand at the same time, they both drink. It requires reading the room, which gets harder with every round.

And then there's **the somaek ritual itself** — the careful pour, the chopstick stirring, the table-slapping to create the perfect mix. Getting the ratio wrong or spilling the drop-shot earns good-natured ridicule and, naturally, another drink.

## The Morning After: Haejang and Recovery

A culture that drinks this much has, naturally, perfected the hangover cure. In Korea, the morning-after ritual is called 해장 (haejang), and it's practically sacred.

**Haejangguk (해장국)** is the classic hangover soup — a steaming, spicy broth loaded with congealed ox blood, vegetables, and sometimes bean sprouts. It sounds intense, and it is, but Koreans swear it works. You'll find dedicated haejangguk restaurants that open at 5 or 6 AM specifically for the post-drinking crowd. Some stay open 24 hours.

**Kongnamul gukbap (콩나물국밥)** — bean sprout rice soup — is the gentler alternative. Hot, clean, restorative. A bowl of this with some kimchi on the side and you start feeling human again.

Then there are the convenience store options. **Condition** and **Dawn 808** are the two biggest hangover drink brands. They come in small bottles, taste vaguely herbal and medicinal, and Koreans down them either before drinking (as prevention) or the morning after (as damage control). Whether they actually work is debatable, but the placebo effect is powerful when you're desperate.

## How Korean Drinking Culture Is Changing

Korean drinking culture in 2026 looks different from even five years ago, and the shift is accelerating.

The biggest driver is generational. The MZ세대 (MZ generation) is pushing back against mandatory drinking at company dinners. Where their parents would never dream of refusing a glass from a boss, younger workers are more comfortable saying no or skipping the hoesik entirely. Some companies have started making these gatherings explicitly optional. The three-round drinking marathon — dinner, then bar, then noraebang — is fading in favor of shorter, more casual outings.

**Homesul (홈술)**, or home drinking, has surged. People buy craft beer, premium soju, or artisanal makgeolli from convenience stores and drink at home while watching Netflix. The pandemic accelerated this, but the trend stuck. It's cheaper, more comfortable, and there's no pressure to keep up with anyone else's pace.

The **craft and traditional spirits** movement is reshaping what Koreans drink. Researchers have been uncovering Joseon Dynasty alcohol recipes, and small distilleries are bringing them back. Regional specialties like Andong soju (a traditional, higher-proof version from the city of Andong) and Jeju omegisul (a millet-based spirit from Jeju Island) are finding audiences beyond their hometowns. The government is offering tax breaks and subsidies to these producers. Even celebrities are getting involved — BTS member Jin partnered with celebrity chef Baek Jong-won to launch IGIN, a Korean apple gin distilled from local rice and apples, which sold out in minutes when it hit the Japanese market.

The health-conscious trend is real too. Lower-ABV options, zero-sugar soju, and the flavored varieties that let people drink more casually without the hard edge of traditional soju are all growing. Premiumization is the industry buzzword: people are drinking less quantity but better quality.

But some things haven't changed. Soju still costs less than a bottle of water. Pojangmacha still light up at dusk. And if someone older hands you a full glass and says "한 잔 하자" — "let's have a drink" — you still take it with both hands, turn your head, and knock it back. Because in Korea, drinking was never really about the alcohol. It's about the person sitting across from you.
