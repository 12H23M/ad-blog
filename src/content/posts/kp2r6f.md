Here's a little secret about traveling in Korea: you don't need to be fluent to have an incredible time. But knowing even a handful of Korean phrases? That changes everything. Shop owners smile wider. Taxi drivers chat with you. Grandmas at the market hand you an extra sample and say something encouraging you can't quite catch yet.

Koreans genuinely appreciate when foreigners make an effort to speak their language. Even a clumsy 감사합니다 (gam-sa-ham-ni-da) — "thank you" — delivered with a slight bow will earn you warmth you wouldn't believe. English is increasingly common in Seoul, sure, but step outside the capital or wander into a neighborhood restaurant. If you want to know what to actually order, check out my [Korean BBQ guide](/food/kb3r9m) or [street food guide](/food/sf7k2x) where the ajumma has been making the same kimchi jjigae for thirty years, and a few Korean words become your lifeline.

So let's get you prepared. These fifty phrases are organized by situation, and I've included the Hangul script, a romanized pronunciation guide, and the English meaning for each one. You don't need to memorize all fifty before your flight. Even picking up ten or fifteen will make your trip noticeably smoother.

## Greetings and Basic Politeness

Korean culture places enormous value on respect, and the language reflects that — your [age even works differently here](/culture/ag4n8w), which directly affects how people talk to you. You'll hear formal and informal speech everywhere, but as a traveler, sticking with polite formal endings (the ones ending in -요, pronounced "yo") keeps you safe in virtually every situation.

**안녕하세요** (an-nyeong-ha-se-yo) — "Hello"

This is your Swiss Army knife. It works morning, afternoon, and evening. Use it walking into shops, greeting hotel staff, or meeting anyone for the first time. You'll hear it constantly, and people will light up when you say it back.

**감사합니다** (gam-sa-ham-ni-da) — "Thank you"

The most formal version of thank you. There's also 고마워요 (go-ma-wo-yo), which is polite but slightly more casual — fine for people around your age in relaxed settings. When in doubt, go with 감사합니다. You literally cannot overuse it in Korea.

**죄송합니다** (joe-song-ham-ni-da) — "I'm sorry" (formal)

Bumped into someone on the subway? Accidentally sat in someone's spot? This is your go-to. For lighter situations — squeezing past someone, getting attention — you can use 실례합니다 (shil-lye-ham-ni-da), which translates closer to "excuse me."

**네** (ne) — "Yes" / **아니요** (a-ni-yo) — "No"

Simple enough, right? One thing to know: Koreans often say 네 as a conversation filler, kind of like "uh-huh" or "I see." So if someone keeps saying 네 while you're talking, they're not necessarily agreeing with everything — they're just showing they're listening.

**괜찮아요** (gwen-chan-a-yo) — "It's okay / I'm fine"

Incredibly versatile. Someone apologizes to you? 괜찮아요. Waiter asks if you need anything else? 괜찮아요. Someone offers you something you don't want? 괜찮아요 with a small hand wave. You'll use this one daily.

**안녕히 가세요** (an-nyeong-hi ga-se-yo) — "Goodbye" (to someone leaving)

**안녕히 계세요** (an-nyeong-hi gye-se-yo) — "Goodbye" (to someone staying)

Korean has two goodbyes depending on who's going where. If you're the one leaving a shop, say 안녕히 계세요 to the person staying behind. If they're the one walking away, it's 안녕히 가세요. Confusing at first, but it becomes second nature fast.

**잠시만요** (jam-shi-man-yo) — "Just a moment, please"

Perfect for when you need a second to look at the menu, find your transit card, or pull up a translation app. It's polite and buys you time without any awkwardness.

**저기요** (jeo-gi-yo) — "Excuse me" (to get attention)

This is how you flag down a waiter at a restaurant, get a shop clerk's attention, or politely interrupt someone. Koreans call out 저기요 all the time in restaurants — it's completely normal and not considered rude at all. In fact, sitting silently and waiting to be noticed is the slower strategy.

## Getting Around

Seoul's public transit system is world-class, but navigating it helps to know a few key phrases. And if you venture beyond the capital, these become even more essential.

**___이/가 어디에 있어요?** (___i/ga eo-di-e iss-eo-yo?) — "Where is ___?"

Fill in the blank with your destination. 화장실이 어디에 있어요? (hwa-jang-shil-i eo-di-e iss-eo-yo?) means "Where is the bathroom?" — probably the single most important question you'll ask. 지하철역이 어디에 있어요? (ji-ha-cheol-yeog-i eo-di-e iss-eo-yo?) gets you to the nearest subway station.

**이 주소로 가 주세요** (i ju-so-ro ga ju-se-yo) — "Please go to this address"

Gold for taxi rides. Pull up the address on your phone in Korean (Naver Map is better than Google Maps in Korea, by the way), show it to the driver, and say this phrase. Works every time.

**여기에서 내려 주세요** (yeo-gi-e-seo nae-ryeo ju-se-yo) — "Please let me off here"

For when you spot your destination from the taxi window or realize you've gone a block too far. Taxi drivers will pull over right away.

**얼마나 걸려요?** (eol-ma-na geol-lyeo-yo?) — "How long does it take?"

Useful for everything — taxi rides, walking directions, waiting for food. Point at a destination on a map or hold up a menu item and ask this.

**오른쪽** (o-reun-jjok) — "Right" / **왼쪽** (oen-jjok) — "Left" / **직진** (jik-jin) — "Straight ahead"

If someone gives you directions, these are the three words to listen for. Even if you can't understand the full sentence, catching 오른쪽 or 왼쪽 tells you which way to turn.

**가까워요?** (ga-kka-wo-yo?) — "Is it close?"

After getting directions, this is a natural follow-up. The answer might come with hand gestures or a head tilt — both very informative in Korea.

**지하철 몇 호선이에요?** (ji-ha-cheol myeot ho-seon-i-e-yo?) — "Which subway line is it?"

Seoul has numbered and color-coded lines. Knowing how to ask which line you need can save you from ending up in the wrong part of the city. Line 2 (the green circle line) is probably the one you'll ride most.

**택시 타는 곳이 어디예요?** (taek-shi ta-neun gos-i eo-di-ye-yo?) — "Where is the taxi stand?"

At train stations and airports, taxis line up at designated stands. This question points you in the right direction.

**환승이에요** (hwan-seung-i-e-yo) — "It's a transfer"

If someone asks where you're going on the subway, or you need to explain that you're switching lines, this word helps. The transfer stations in Seoul are well-signed, but knowing the word makes overhead announcements suddenly recognizable.

## Ordering Food and Drinks

Korean restaurants run on a beautiful system of efficiency. Many have buzzers, some have tablet ordering, and nearly all of them expect you to call out when you're ready. Knowing these phrases turns a potentially confusing meal into a confident one.

**메뉴 주세요** (me-nyu ju-se-yo) — "Menu, please"

Some smaller restaurants don't hand you a menu automatically — it might be on the wall, or the owner just assumes you know what they serve (they've been making three dishes for twenty years, after all). Asking for a menu gets things rolling.

**이거 주세요** (i-geo ju-se-yo) — "This one, please"

Point at the menu, point at someone else's table, point at the food display by the counter. Combined with a finger point, 이거 주세요 is unstoppable. Honestly, this single phrase can carry you through most meals in Korea.

**물 주세요** (mul ju-se-yo) — "Water, please"

Water is free at Korean restaurants and usually self-serve from a dispenser. But if you can't find it, just ask. You can also swap out 물 for anything else: 맥주 주세요 (maek-ju ju-se-yo) for beer, 소주 주세요 (so-ju ju-se-yo) for soju.

**하나 더 주세요** (ha-na deo ju-se-yo) — "One more, please"

Want another round of side dishes? More rice? Another bottle of soju? This handles all of it. Side dish refills are free at most Korean restaurants, and asking for more is completely expected.

**맛있어요** (ma-shi-sseo-yo) — "It's delicious"

Say this to the person who cooked your food and watch their face. Especially at small family-run places, a sincere 맛있어요 is the highest compliment you can give. They might even bring you a little something extra.

**덜 맵게 해 주세요** (deol maep-ge hae ju-se-yo) — "Please make it less spicy"

Korean food can be seriously spicy. Not every dish, but enough that this phrase earns its place. Some restaurants can adjust the spice level; others can't. Worth asking either way.

**계산이요** (gye-san-i-yo) — "Check, please"

When you're ready to pay, call this out or say it as you walk to the counter. Many Korean restaurants have you pay at the register near the door rather than at the table.

**카드 돼요?** (ka-deu dwae-yo?) — "Can I pay by card?"

Korea is almost entirely cashless. Credit and debit cards work nearly everywhere, even at tiny street food stalls. But "almost" isn't "always," so it's good to check. The answer is usually 네 with a nod.

**알레르기가 있어요** (al-le-reu-gi-ga iss-eo-yo) — "I have allergies"

Follow this with the ingredient if you can, or show a pre-written allergy card on your phone. Common ones to know: 땅콩 (ttang-kong) for peanuts, 해산물 (hae-san-mul) for seafood, 우유 (u-yu) for milk.

**잘 먹겠습니다** (jal meok-ge-sseum-ni-da) — "I will eat well" (said before eating)

This isn't a prayer — it's a polite expression of gratitude for the food. Koreans say it before meals the way some cultures say grace. Using it shows cultural awareness that goes beyond just knowing vocabulary.

## Shopping and Numbers

Korean uses two number systems, which sounds intimidating but is manageable once you understand when each one applies. For prices, you'll almost always use Sino-Korean numbers (the system borrowed from Chinese). For counting items, you'll use pure Korean numbers. Let's focus on what you'll actually need while shopping.

**Sino-Korean numbers for prices:**

These are the ones you'll hear at cash registers and markets. The currency is 원 (won).

천 (cheon) is 1,000. 오천 (o-cheon) is 5,000. 만 (man) is 10,000 — and this is the big one, because Koreans think in units of 만. So 50,000 won is 오만 원 (o-man won), not "fifty thousand." Getting used to 만 as a mental unit takes a day or two, then it clicks.

**Pure Korean numbers for counting items:**

하나 (ha-na) — one, 둘 (dul) — two, 셋 (set) — three, 넷 (net) — four, 다섯 (da-seot) — five. You'll use these when saying how many of something you want: 두 개 주세요 (du gae ju-se-yo) means "Two, please."

**얼마예요?** (eol-ma-ye-yo?) — "How much is it?"

The essential market phrase. At traditional markets where prices aren't posted, you'll use this constantly. Sometimes the vendor will punch the number into a calculator and show you, which honestly makes things easier for everyone.

**너무 비싸요** (neo-mu bi-ssa-yo) — "It's too expensive"

Haggling isn't as common in Korea as in some other Asian countries, but at traditional markets and certain shopping areas like Namdaemun, a friendly 너무 비싸요 with a smile can sometimes nudge the price down. Don't push hard — gentle negotiation is the Korean way.

**깎아 주세요** (kkakk-a ju-se-yo) — "Please give me a discount"

More direct than saying it's expensive, this is an actual request for a lower price. Use it at markets, not at department stores or convenience stores. Context matters.

**이거 입어 봐도 돼요?** (i-geo ib-eo bwa-do dwae-yo?) — "Can I try this on?"

For clothing shopping in areas like Hongdae or Myeongdong. Some smaller boutiques don't allow try-ons, so asking first is polite.

**영수증 주세요** (yeong-su-jeung ju-se-yo) — "Receipt, please"

Useful if you're doing tax-free shopping or just want to keep track of spending. Many stores ask 영수증 필요하세요? (do you need a receipt?), so recognizing the word helps.

**카드로 할게요** (ka-deu-ro hal-ge-yo) — "I'll pay by card"

**현금으로 할게요** (hyeon-geum-eu-ro hal-ge-yo) — "I'll pay in cash"

At checkout, the clerk might ask how you'd like to pay. These two options cover it. Card is overwhelmingly more common, but some traditional markets still prefer cash.

## Emergency and Helpful Phrases

Hopefully you won't need most of these, but having them ready — even saved on your phone — provides real peace of mind.

**도와주세요** (do-wa-ju-se-yo) — "Please help me"

Straightforward and universally understood. Koreans are generally very willing to help lost or confused foreigners, so don't hesitate to approach someone.

**병원** (byeong-won) — "Hospital" / **약국** (yak-guk) — "Pharmacy"

Pharmacies in Korea are everywhere and pharmacists can recommend over-the-counter treatments for common issues. You don't always need a hospital — 약국 handles a lot. If you need to say "I'm sick," that's 아파요 (a-pa-yo).

**경찰서가 어디에 있어요?** (gyeong-chal-seo-ga eo-di-e iss-eo-yo?) — "Where is the police station?"

Korea is extremely safe, but if something does happen, police stations are easy to find. The emergency number is 112 for police and 119 for fire and ambulance.

**한국어 못해요** (han-gug-eo mo-tae-yo) — "I can't speak Korean"

Deliver this with an apologetic smile. Most Koreans will immediately switch to gestures, simpler words, or pull out a translation app. People are remarkably patient.

**영어 할 수 있어요?** (yeong-eo hal su iss-eo-yo?) — "Can you speak English?"

Younger Koreans — especially in Seoul — often speak some English and are happy to practice. Older Koreans might not, but they'll usually find someone nearby who can help.

**와이파이 비밀번호가 뭐예요?** (wa-i-pa-i bi-mil-beon-ho-ga mwo-ye-yo?) — "What is the wifi password?"

Every cafe, restaurant, and guesthouse has wifi. The password is often posted on the wall or on the table, but if you can't spot it, this question works. Sometimes it's just the phone number of the business.

**화장실이 어디에 있어요?** (hwa-jang-shil-i eo-di-e iss-eo-yo?) — "Where is the restroom?"

We covered this in directions, but it deserves repeating here because you will use it every single day. Public restrooms in Korea are generally clean and well-maintained, often found in subway stations.

**___ 있어요?** (___iss-eo-yo?) — "Do you have ___?"

Another fill-in-the-blank gem. 충전기 있어요? (chung-jeon-gi iss-eo-yo?) for "Do you have a charger?" or 큰 사이즈 있어요? (keun sa-i-jeu iss-eo-yo?) for "Do you have a bigger size?" Endlessly adaptable.

**여권을 잃어버렸어요** (yeo-gwon-eul ilh-eo-beo-ryeoss-eo-yo) — "I lost my passport"

A phrase you hope never to use. If it happens, head to the nearest police station to file a report, then contact your embassy. Having this phrase ready removes one layer of panic from an already stressful situation.

**천천히 말해 주세요** (cheon-cheon-hi mal-hae ju-se-yo) — "Please speak slowly"

When someone responds to your Korean and suddenly you're drowning in words you don't recognize, this phrase is a lifesaver. Koreans often speed up when they realize you speak some Korean, taking it as a sign you understand more than you do.

## Bonus: Phrases That Will Impress Koreans

These aren't strictly necessary for survival, but dropping them at the right moment earns you genuine reactions — surprise, laughter, and sometimes a new friend.

**대박** (dae-bak) — "Awesome / No way!"

Originally slang, now completely mainstream. Use it when someone tells you something surprising or when you taste something incredible. It's the Korean equivalent of "wow" and it sounds natural coming from anyone.

**진짜요?** (jin-jja-yo?) — "Really?"

If you've watched even one K-drama, you've heard this. It works in every situation where you'd say "seriously?" or "for real?" in English.

**맞아요** (maj-a-yo) — "That's right / Exactly"

Great for conversations. When someone explains something and you want to show you follow, 맞아요 keeps the dialogue flowing.

**오빠/언니** (oppa/eonni) — "Older brother" (said by females) / "Older sister" (said by females)

**형/누나** (hyeong/nu-na) — "Older brother" (said by males) / "Older sister" (said by males)

Korean doesn't really use first names casually. These terms show you understand the relationship dynamics. Use them with Koreans you've gotten friendly with — at a bar, with a guesthouse host, or with new friends. It creates an instant sense of closeness.

**수고하셨습니다** (su-go-ha-syeoss-seum-ni-da) — "You've worked hard"

Say this to anyone finishing their work — a delivery person, a tour guide, a cashier at the end of their shift. There's no clean English equivalent, and that's exactly why Koreans are so impressed when foreigners use it. It shows you understand something cultural, not just linguistic.

**한국이 너무 좋아요** (han-gug-i neo-mu jo-a-yo) — "I really like Korea"

Simple. Honest. And it opens doors. Taxi drivers have been known to recommend their favorite restaurants after hearing this. Shopkeepers might give you a small freebie. It communicates that you're not just passing through — you're paying attention.

**소맥** (so-maek) — "Soju + beer mix"

Order this at a bar or 치맥 (chi-maek — chicken and beer) restaurant and you immediately signal that you know what's up. Mixing soju and beer is a beloved Korean drinking custom, and knowing the slang word for it sets a fun tone for the evening.

Korea rewards curiosity. You don't need perfect pronunciation or flawless grammar — you need willingness. Save this list on your phone, practice a few phrases on the plane, and use them fearlessly once you land. The worst that can happen is a gentle correction. The best? A genuine connection that turns a good trip into an unforgettable one.

For continued learning, apps like Talk To Me In Korean (TTMIK) and the Sejong Institute's free online courses are excellent starting points. But honestly, your best classroom is the streets of Korea itself. Order in Korean. Ask for directions. Compliment someone's cooking. Every small interaction builds confidence, and Koreans will cheer you on the entire way.
