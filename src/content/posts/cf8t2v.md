Last week my younger son asked if we could stop at Mega Coffee on the way home from hagwon. We'd already passed three other cafés in the two blocks since leaving. I said yes, obviously — it was a 1,800 won iced Americano kind of afternoon. While we waited for our drinks, I counted the coffee shops visible from the window. Four. Four cafés within maybe a hundred meters of each other. That's not unusual here. That's just Korea.

If you've walked around any Korean city, you've noticed. Cafés everywhere. Stacked on top of each other, tucked into basement levels, sprawling across rooftops. Korea has over 100,000 cafés, which works out to roughly 1,384 coffee shops per million people — the highest density in the world. Japan comes in second at about 529. We more than double them. And honestly, we need every single one.

## Korea Runs on Iced Americanos

Koreans drink somewhere between 405 and 512 cups of coffee per person per year, depending on which study you look at. The global average is 152. We basically triple it.

But here's the thing that catches most visitors off guard: we drink our Americanos iced. Year-round. It'll be negative ten outside, snow on the ground, wind cutting through your jacket, and the person next to you at the bus stop is clutching a giant iced Americano like it's July. We have a nickname for it — "아아" (ah-ah), short for 아이스 아메리카노. Ask any Korean what "ah-ah" means and they'll know instantly.

My husband does this. Dead of winter, full padding jacket, iced coffee in hand. I used to think he was being dramatic. But then I started doing it too. There's something about the cold, bitter hit of an iced Americano that just works, no matter the season. It's become such a cultural thing that memes about Koreans drinking iced coffee in winter are practically a genre of their own.

## The Chain Breakdown: Budget, Mid-Range, and Premium

One thing that surprises visitors is how affordable coffee can be here. The budget café scene has exploded in the past few years, and while the 1,500 won Americano era officially ended in 2025 thanks to global coffee bean prices, you can still get a solid cup for under 2,000 won.

**Mega Coffee** is the giant. Over 3,400 stores and counting. Their Americano comes in a 600ml cup with two shots for about 1,800 won — that's barely over a dollar. They even have a supersized 960ml option with four shots for 3,000 won if you're having one of those days. The cups are comically large. My kids call them "arm coffee" because you need your whole forearm to hold one.

**Compose Coffee** and **Paik's Coffee** are in the same price range. Paik's was founded by Baek Jong-won, the celebrity chef you've probably seen if you watch any Korean variety shows. Compose just got acquired by Jollibee and is expanding internationally — I spotted one in Singapore last year.

In the middle sits **Ediya Coffee**, with almost 4,000 locations making it the largest Korean café chain by store count. At 3,200 won for an Americano, it's not budget but not splurging either. College students live at Ediya. It's their second home.

Then there's the premium tier. **A Twosome Place** positions itself as a "Premium Dessert Café" — the cakes are the real draw, especially their strawberry chocolate cake that's sold over 10 million slices. And **Starbucks Korea** operates about 2,050 stores, all company-owned (no franchises), charging around 4,700 won for a tall Americano. Koreans are famously obsessive about Starbucks merchandise here. Limited-edition tumblers cause actual lines around the block. I've woken up early to grab a seasonal tumbler before. No shame.

The funny thing is that most of us bounce between all these tiers depending on the day. Quick grab-and-go on a Monday morning? Mega Coffee. Meeting a friend for a long chat? A Twosome Place. Need a spot to work on my laptop? Ediya. Different cafés for different moods — that's just how it works.

## Drinks You Won't Find Anywhere Else

Korean cafés don't just serve coffee and tea. The menu innovation here is relentless because competition forces every shop to stand out.

**Einspanner** is everywhere now. Originally Austrian, the Korean version is espresso topped with a thick crown of sweet whipped cream, served in a clear glass so you can see the layers. It looks stunning and tastes like dessert. Every café has their own spin — matcha einspanner, chocolate einspanner, strawberry einspanner.

**Ade drinks** are a whole category unto themselves. These are sparkling fruit beverages — not soda, but fresh fruit syrup or purée mixed with sparkling water. Grapefruit ade, peach ade, lemon ade, watermelon ade in summer. They're refreshing in a way that's hard to describe until you've had one on a humid August day in Seoul.

Then there are the drinks rooted in Korean ingredients. **Sweet potato latte** shows up every fall — creamy, slightly sweet, made with real roasted sweet potatoes. **Misugaru latte** uses traditional Korean multigrain powder (a mix of roasted barley, oats, brown rice, and other grains) blended with milk and honey. My grandmother drank misugaru mixed with cold water in summer. Now my older son orders it at a café with oat milk. Same drink, different generation.

Other uniquely Korean options include mugwort latte, black sesame latte, red bean latte, and yuja (citron) tea in winter. Some cafés even do a Jolly Pong latte — if you don't know Jolly Pong, it's a puffed wheat snack that every Korean kid grows up eating. Blending it into a latte sounds weird, but it works.

And every season brings a completely new rotation. Cherry blossom lattes in spring, fruit ades in summer, pumpkin and chestnut drinks in fall, ginger and citrus teas in winter. Walking into a Korean café in October feels completely different from walking into the same one in April.

## Bingsu, Croffles, and the Dessert Situation

You can't talk about Korean cafés without talking about desserts. Some cafés are really dessert shops that happen to serve coffee.

**Bingsu** is the crown jewel — shaved ice, but not the crunchy, syrup-drenched kind you might be picturing. Korean bingsu uses frozen milk that's shaved into impossibly fine, snow-like flakes. It melts on your tongue. Classic patbingsu comes topped with sweet red beans, mochi, and condensed milk. Modern versions go wild: mango cheesecake bingsu, matcha tiramisu bingsu, injeolmi bingsu dusted in roasted soybean flour. Sulbing is the most famous chain for it, but honestly almost every café offers their own version in summer. A bowl runs about 8,000 to 15,000 won and it's usually big enough to split.

**Croffles** — croissant meets waffle — have become a permanent fixture on Seoul café menus. Crispy, buttery, served with ice cream or chocolate or just on their own. My older son would eat one every day if I let him.

**Ttuungcarong** (fat macarons) are the Korean twist on French macarons — oversized, stuffed with thick fillings like cream cheese, buttercream, or ganache. They're almost comically large compared to a Parisian macaron. And then there's the basque cheesecake trend, soufflé pancakes that jiggle when you poke them, and Korean-style soufflé cheesecake that's so light it practically floats.

## Study Cafés and Themed Cafés: Not Just About Coffee

Korean café culture goes way beyond drinking coffee. Some of the most interesting spots aren't really about beverages at all.

**Study cafés** (스터디카페) are a whole phenomenon. You pay by the hour — walk in, scan at a kiosk, pick your seat, and study or work in blissful quiet. They're open 24 hours, have free Wi-Fi, power outlets at every desk, and complimentary drinks. Headphones are mandatory; no talking. Adults make up about 80% of users now, not just students. After COVID, a lot of freelancers and remote workers basically moved into these places. For the cost of a few hours at a study café, you get a quieter, more focused environment than any regular café.

There's also "카공" (kagong) culture — a blend of "café" and "study." People camp out at regular cafés with their laptops and textbooks for hours, and most places genuinely don't mind. Some cafés even set up special long tables and individual booths specifically for laptop users.

**Themed cafés** are the other extreme — pure fun, zero productivity. Animal cafés with cats, dogs, raccoons, or even meerkats. Character cafés themed around Line Friends or Kakao. Board game cafés where you can play for hours. Hanok cafés set in traditional Korean houses. A café in Seongsu-dong called Rain Report has actual artificial rain falling inside and outside. Kids cafés are a lifesaver for parents like me — your children play in an indoor playground while you sit down with an actual warm cup of coffee. Revolutionary.

## Café Etiquette You Should Know

A few things that'll save you from awkward moments.

**Save your seat first.** Walk in, put your bag or phone on a table, then go order. Nobody will take your stuff or your seat. This mutual trust thing still blows foreign visitors' minds, but it's completely normal here. I leave my phone on the table and go order without a second thought.

**Kiosks are standard.** Most chain cafés use touchscreen ordering. Walk up to the screen, pick your drink, pay by card. Some places don't even have a counter for verbal ordering anymore. If the kiosk has an English option, use it — but honestly, the drinks are listed in Korean and English at most chains.

**No tipping.** Not at cafés, not at restaurants, not anywhere. The price on the menu is the price. Tax is included.

**Clean up after yourself.** Bring your tray back, separate your recyclables (cup, lid, straw go in different bins), and wipe down your table. Staff won't chase you down, but self-cleanup is the norm.

**One drink per person is the rule** at most cafés, especially the nicer ones. Splitting one Americano between two people while taking up a table is generally frowned upon.

## Where to Go Café Hopping

If you're visiting Korea and want the full café experience, here are the neighborhoods to hit.

**Seongsu-dong** in Seoul is the spot right now. Old warehouses and factories converted into massive, dramatic café spaces with raw concrete walls, high ceilings, and art installations. It's been called "the Brooklyn of Seoul." Nudake (by the Gentle Monster team) feels more like a gallery than a café. Rain Report has that indoor rain I mentioned. Café Far Ben was opened by BTS RM's younger sister. Come on a weekday if you can — weekends are packed.

**Yeonnam-dong** is the chill alternative. Quiet residential streets with cafés tucked into converted old houses along the Gyeongui Line Forest Park. Walk 400 meters along the park path and you'll pass a dozen unique spots. Coffee Nap Roasters is beautiful — 7,000 red bricks, floor-to-ceiling windows. There's even a Studio Ghibli-themed café called Koriko.

**Ikseon-dong** is for the hanok lovers — tiny alleyways of traditional Korean houses repurposed as cafés, tea rooms, and dessert shops. It's the most photogenic café neighborhood in Seoul, hands down.

Outside Seoul, **Gangneung** on the east coast is literally called "The City of Coffee." Anmok Coffee Street is a 500-meter stretch of over 30 cafés right along the beach, most roasting their own beans. The ocean view from your table while sipping a hand-dripped pour-over is hard to beat. Take the KTX from Seoul — it's about two hours and completely worth it.

And then there's **Jeju Island**, which has become café paradise. Cliffside cafés overlooking the ocean, converted historical buildings, hallabong citrus drinks you can only get on the island. If you visit Jeju and don't spend at least one afternoon café hopping along the Aewol coast, you're missing out.

## It's More Than Coffee

What I love about Korean café culture — and I think what surprises most visitors — is that it's not really about the coffee. I mean, the coffee is great. But cafés here are where you meet friends, where you study, where you take your kids on a rainy Saturday, where you sit alone with your thoughts for an hour. They're living rooms, offices, playgrounds, and date spots all rolled into one.

We have 100,000 of them for a reason. Come visit and you'll understand why we need every single one.
