When my husband and I bought our first apartment in Bundang about fifteen years ago, his mother's first question wasn't about the price or the size. She asked which floor we were on and whether the morning sunlight hit the living room. That's Korea for you. We take our apartments seriously.

If you're thinking about living in Korea, or you're just curious about how we live, let me walk you through what apartment life actually looks like here. It's probably nothing like what you're imagining.

## Over 80% of Us Live in Apartments — And We Like It That Way

Foreigners sometimes ask me, "Don't you want a house with a yard?" Honestly? Not really. Our apartments aren't like the ones you might picture in other countries. They're part of massive complexes called 단지 (danji), and each one is basically a small town.

My complex has two playgrounds, a fitness center, underground parking for every unit, a security team that works around the clock, and a row of shops at the ground level with a bakery, a convenience store. Between the [convenience stores](/food/cv7n3k) and delivery apps, you barely need to cook, and three different hagwons for my kids. I can handle groceries, my son's math tutoring, and picking up dry cleaning without ever leaving the complex.

The first apartment complex in Korea was built in Mapo back in 1964. Since then, apartments have become the dominant way Koreans live. Over 62% of all housing in Korea is apartment buildings, and in cities, more than 80% of people live in them. Big construction companies like Samsung, Hyundai, and Lotte all have their own apartment brands. Samsung has "Raemian," Hyundai has "Hillstate," and there's also GS "Xi" and Daewoo "Prugio." The brand name on the sign at the entrance matters to people here, sometimes more than the actual layout of the unit.

Each complex has a management office, the 관리사무소, that handles everything from security to landscaping to package deliveries. When my washing machine started leaking last winter, I didn't call a plumber. I called the management office, and they had someone at my door within the hour. That's the kind of convenience you get.

## The Rental System That Confuses Every Foreigner

If you've ever looked into renting in Korea, you probably hit a wall when you encountered 전세 (jeonse). Let me break it down.

**Jeonse** means you hand over a massive lump sum deposit — sometimes 50 to 80% of the property's value — and in return, you pay zero monthly rent. The landlord takes your money, invests it, earns returns on it, and gives the whole deposit back when you move out, usually after two years. Right now, the average jeonse deposit in Seoul is about 680 million won, which is roughly $520,000. And that's the average.

The system started back in the 1960s and 70s when Korea was urbanizing fast and banks weren't lending easily. It worked well for decades, but it's been shifting. In 2022, monthly rent contracts (월세, wolse) actually surpassed jeonse contracts for the first time. A government minister even said that jeonse is "a system whose time has passed." There have been too many scam cases where landlords couldn't return deposits.

**Wolse** is more straightforward. You pay a smaller deposit plus monthly rent. Foreigners almost always go with this option. A typical arrangement might be a 10 million won deposit with 600,000 to 1.5 million won in monthly rent, depending on the neighborhood and apartment type.

Then there's **banjeonse** (반전세), which splits the difference. You put down a bigger deposit than wolse but smaller than jeonse, and pay reduced monthly rent. My sister-in-law does this for her place in Gangnam. I covered the different vibes in my [Seoul neighborhood guide](/travel/sn9t4c). She says it gives her "the best of both worlds," though I think she just couldn't scrape together a full jeonse deposit.

## Housing Types: It's Not Just "Apartments"

When Koreans say "아파트" (apartment), we mean the big high-rise complexes with hundreds or thousands of units. But there are other options too.

**빌라 (Villa)** — Don't let the fancy-sounding name fool you. A villa is a low-rise building, usually five floors or fewer, often without an elevator. They're more affordable but have fewer amenities. No security team, no underground parking, no community gym. My parents lived in a villa when I was in elementary school, and I remember hauling groceries up four flights of stairs in the summer.

**오피스텔 (Officetel)** — A mix of office and hotel. These are compact units in mixed-use buildings, popular with young professionals and singles. They tend to have good security and modern finishes, but the spaces are tight and the maintenance fees can be surprisingly high.

**원룸 (One-Room)** — Exactly what it sounds like. Everything in one room: your bed, your kitchen counter, your desk. Typically 20 to 35 square meters. College students and fresh graduates live in these. My nephew just moved into one near Hongdae, and he keeps complaining that his kitchen is basically a hot plate next to his closet.

**고시원 (Goshiwon)** — These were originally tiny study rooms for people preparing for civil service exams, but now they're ultra-budget housing. Shared bathrooms, minimal space. I wouldn't recommend them for anything longer than a very temporary stay.

## Ondol: Why We Heat the Floor, Not the Air

Nothing surprises foreigners more than ondol (온돌), our floor heating system. And honestly, once you've experienced it, you'll never want to go back to central heating through vents.

Ondol is over 2,000 years old. The word literally means "warm stone." Traditional ondol worked by channeling smoke from a firebox through passages under the stone floor, so the entire floor radiated heat. There are old stories about legendary ondol rooms that stayed warm for 45 days from a single firing.

Modern apartments use the same principle, just updated. Hot water runs through pipes embedded in the floor, heated by a gas boiler. Over 90% of Korean homes have this system. Every apartment I've ever lived in has had it. You control the temperature through your wallpad or a thermostat, usually setting it around 20 to 22 degrees in winter. It takes about 30 minutes to fully heat up, and then your entire floor becomes a warm surface.

This is why we live on the floor. We sit on the floor, eat at low tables, and many of us sleep on the floor too — or at least, we did growing up. My kids have beds now, but when winter comes, I still catch my younger son dragging his blanket onto the heated living room floor. Even the sofa becomes a backrest rather than a seat. You sit in front of it, not on it.

And this is exactly why we take off shoes at the door. The floor isn't just a floor in Korean homes. It's where you eat, sit, play, and sleep. Walking on it with outdoor shoes would be unthinkable.

## The Entryway: Where Korean Homes Really Begin

Every Korean home has a 현관 (hyeon-gwan), a slightly lowered area right at the entrance where you leave your shoes. It's the boundary between outside and inside, and crossing it in shoes is one of the biggest faux pas you can commit in someone's home.

Some hosts provide slippers, but most of us just walk around in socks or bare feet. I keep a little shoe rack in my hyeon-gwan that's perpetually overflowing, especially when my kids have friends over. On weekends, there might be eight pairs of sneakers crammed in there.

This isn't just about cleanliness. It's tied to our entire way of living on the floor. When I visited a friend in the U.S. and she walked across her carpet with shoes on, I physically flinched. I know it's normal there, but my body just reacted.

## Moving Day in Korea Looks Like Nothing You've Seen

When Koreans move apartments, you might see something that looks bizarre from the outside: a truck with a massive extending ladder platform reaching up to a fifth-floor window, with workers loading a refrigerator through it.

That's a 사다리차 (sadaricha), a ladder truck. It's standard here because many buildings, especially villas, have narrow stairwells and small elevators. Workers remove the window or balcony door, extend the platform, and shuttle everything in and out through the opening. It costs around 80,000 to 100,000 won depending on the floor and the amount of stuff.

Korean movers are incredibly efficient. A full-packing move (포장이사) means a team of about five people shows up, packs literally everything in your home, transports it, and unpacks it at the new place. Some even organize your kitchen. It's an experience.

One thing that might surprise you: many families still check the almanac for an auspicious moving day, 손 없는 날, when evil spirits supposedly aren't active. My mother-in-law insisted on this when we moved. I didn't argue.

## Housewarming the Korean Way

After you move in, you throw a 집들이 (jipdeuri), a housewarming party. But there are unwritten rules.

First, you don't invite everyone at once. You throw separate parties for different groups — family, coworkers, college friends, neighborhood acquaintances. Mixing groups is awkward in Korean social culture, so we keep them separate. I threw four different jipdeuri when we moved into our current place. Four rounds of cooking. My husband was on dishwashing duty for days.

The traditional gifts people bring are practical with symbolic meaning:

- **Toilet paper** — symbolizes life unrolling smoothly. It goes back to a time when toilet paper was actually expensive.
- **Laundry detergent** — the bubbles represent prosperity and abundance.
- **Potted plants** — symbolize health and growth.

As the host, you're expected to serve food. Rice cakes (떡) are traditional because they symbolize good fortune. I usually make a spread of jeon (savory pancakes) too because they're easy to prepare in large batches and everyone loves them.

In the old days, you'd also share 시루떡 (red bean steamed rice cake) with your new neighbors to introduce yourself. That tradition is fading, but some older residents in my complex still do it.

## The Noise Issue: Korea's Apartment Headache

Living above and below other families means noise is a constant tension. 층간소음 (inter-floor noise) is one of the most talked-about social problems in Korea. It's led to real conflicts — arguments, lawsuits, and in extreme cases, violence.

The biggest trigger? Kids running indoors. I've been on both sides of this. When my older son was five, the neighbor below us knocked on our door to complain. We bought thick play mats for the entire living room floor. Years later, the family above us had a toddler who apparently trained for marathons every evening at 9 PM. I understood the frustration firsthand.

There are actual legal limits: 43 decibels during the day, 57 decibels at night. Newer apartments are required to have floor slabs at least 25 centimeters thick with cushioning material. Samsung C&T even built a lab specifically dedicated to studying inter-floor noise.

If you have a noise problem, the unofficial rule is to report it to the security office rather than confronting your neighbor directly. There's also a national complaint hotline (1661-2642). Direct confrontation rarely ends well.

## Recycling: Korea's Strictest Apartment Rule

The recycling system in Korea would make most countries' heads spin, but once you learn it, it becomes second nature.

General waste goes into official volume-based bags (종량제 봉투) that you buy at the convenience store. Each district has its own bags, so you can't use Gangnam bags in Songpa. Sizes range from 10 liters to 100 liters, and yes, you're paying for each bag. It's the government's way of reducing waste.

Recyclables get sorted into categories: plastic, glass, paper, cans, and styrofoam. Everything must be rinsed clean with labels and caps removed. Getting this wrong earns you a passive-aggressive note from the management office. Getting it really wrong earns you a fine of up to 300,000 won, especially since CCTV cameras monitor the waste stations.

Food waste goes into special bins — many apartment complexes now have smart bins that weigh what you dump and charge you per kilogram. But not everything counts as food waste. Bones, shells, tea bags, and onion peels go in general waste. I still have to remind my kids about this.

Collection is usually in the evening, after 6 PM, or early morning. The recycling area in my apartment complex gets busy right after dinner, with everyone sorting their plastics and folding their cardboard boxes. It's oddly communal.

## Smart Homes: The Wallpad Runs Everything

If you walk into almost any Korean apartment built in the last 15 years, you'll see a small screen mounted on the wall near the entrance. That's the 월패드 (wallpad), and it controls practically everything.

From the wallpad, I can see who's at the front gate, unlock the building entrance, control the floor heating and ventilation, turn lights on and off, and even call the security desk. Newer models have apps, so I can control everything from my phone. When it's cold, I turn on the ondol from the car so the apartment is warm by the time we walk in.

Korea's smart home market is projected to reach $18 billion by 2030. Companies like Samsung SmartThings and LG ThinQ are integrating everything — door locks, air purifiers, rice cookers, washing machines — into single ecosystems. Some newer complexes even have the front gate recognizing your smartphone and opening automatically.

There's been a downside, though. Wallpad hacking became a real scandal a few years ago, with personal videos being stolen and distributed. The government now requires mandatory encryption and authentication protocols for all wallpad systems. It was a wake-up call for the whole industry.

## What an Average Apartment Costs Right Now

I'm not going to sugarcoat this: Korean real estate, especially in Seoul, is expensive. The median apartment price in Seoul is now above 1.1 billion won (roughly $830,000), and the average is above 1.5 billion won. That's about 15 times the typical Seoul household income.

Seoul apartment prices rose 8.71% in 2025, the fastest pace in nearly two decades. Hot districts like Songpa, Yongsan, and Seocho saw 10 to 15% annual growth. And 2026 isn't looking much cooler, with a sharp drop in new apartment supply expected to keep prices elevated.

Outside of Seoul, things are more reasonable. The national average is around 470 million won, making Seoul roughly three times pricier than the rest of the country. Cities like Daejeon, Daegu, and smaller metros offer similar apartment living at a fraction of Seoul's cost.

For foreigners renting, expect to budget at least 1 to 2 million won per month for a decent one-bedroom in Seoul, plus a deposit of 10 to 20 million won. Outside of Seoul, you can find good places for significantly less.

## Living Here Is Different, But You Get Used to It Fast

Korean apartment living has its quirks. You'll learn to recycle like a professional, keep your voice down after 10 PM, and appreciate the miracle of a warm floor on a freezing January morning. You'll figure out that the wallpad isn't just decoration and that your neighbors' phone number on their car dashboard isn't an invitation to chat — it's so you can call them to move their double-parked car.

The first few weeks feel like a learning curve. The recycling alone takes some adjustment. But after a while, the security, the convenience, the community, the heated floors — it all clicks. My foreign friends who've lived here always tell me the same thing: they didn't expect to love it, but they do.

That's apartment life in Korea. It's not just a place to sleep. It's a whole system, a whole culture, and honestly, once you're in it, it's hard to imagine living any other way.
