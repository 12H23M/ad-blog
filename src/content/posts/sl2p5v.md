If you've ever been in Seoul during late January or early February and noticed something strange — eerily empty subway cars, shuttered restaurants, streets that are usually packed suddenly feeling like a ghost town — you probably stumbled into Seollal weekend. Korea's Lunar New Year holiday is the one time of year when the entire country collectively hits pause. Millions of people leave the cities and head to their hometowns, highways turn into parking lots, and the usual frenetic energy of Korean life gives way to something quieter, warmer, and deeply rooted in tradition.

Seollal (설날) isn't just a day off work. It's the single most important family gathering on the Korean calendar, bigger even than Chuseok in many people's eyes. And whether you're living in Korea, visiting during the holiday, or just curious about what makes this celebration so special, understanding Seollal gives you a real window into what family, respect, and togetherness mean in Korean culture.

## What Is Seollal and When Does It Happen

Seollal follows the lunar calendar, which means the date shifts every year on the Western calendar. It typically falls somewhere between late January and mid-February. In 2026, Seollal lands on February 17th, but Koreans get a three-day public holiday — the day before, the day of, and the day after. Many people take additional vacation days to extend the break, so you might see the slowdown start almost a week before the actual date.

This isn't like Christmas in Western countries where celebrations build over weeks. Seollal hits fast. One day everything is normal, and the next day half the population is on the move. The Korean expressway system, which is actually excellent most of the year, becomes the stuff of nightmares. A drive from Seoul to Busan that normally takes around four hours can stretch to eight, ten, sometimes even twelve hours. People check real-time traffic apps obsessively, leave at 3 AM to beat the rush, or resign themselves to crawling along at walking speed with everyone else.

The holiday centers on the first day of the lunar new year, and it carries enormous cultural weight. Koreans traditionally consider Seollal their real new year. While January 1st is recognized and celebrated with countdown events and fireworks, Seollal is the holiday that matters on a personal and family level. It's when you pay respects to ancestors, reconnect with relatives you haven't seen in months, and — if you're a kid — collect envelopes of cash. More on that shortly.

One thing worth knowing: Korea used to follow the lunar calendar exclusively. The switch to the solar calendar happened during the Japanese colonial period, but Seollal persisted because it was too deeply woven into Korean identity to let go. The government officially recognized it as a public holiday again in 1985 after decades of trying (and failing) to get people to abandon it. Culture won that battle.

## The Traditions That Define Seollal

The heart of Seollal morning is **charye** (차례), a formal ancestral rite. Families set up an elaborate table filled with carefully arranged food — rice, soup, meat, fish, vegetables, fruit, and rice cakes — all facing a specific direction according to traditional rules. The arrangement isn't random. There's a saying, "어동육서" (eo-dong-yuk-seo), meaning fish goes on the east side and meat on the west. Red fruits go on the east, white fruits on the west. Older generations take these placements seriously, and getting it wrong can spark some surprisingly heated family debates.

The family then performs a series of deep bows toward the ancestral tablets or photographs, offering food and drink to the spirits of deceased family members. It's a solemn moment, connecting the living to those who came before. Even in modern, apartment-dwelling Korea, you'll find families clearing their living room furniture to make space for this ritual.

After charye comes **sebae** (세배), and this is the part that kids look forward to all year. Sebae is a formal New Year's bow performed by younger family members to their elders. You kneel on the floor, place your hands together, and perform a deep bow — forehead nearly touching your hands. While bowing, you say something like "새해 복 많이 받으세요" (saehae bok mani badeuseyo), which means "Please receive lots of blessings in the new year."

The elders respond with words of wisdom or encouragement — study hard, stay healthy, find a good spouse (Korean grandparents are nothing if not direct). Then comes the good part: **sebaetdon** (세뱃돈), New Year's money tucked into crisp envelopes. The amount varies. Grandparents might give 50,000 won or more per grandchild. Parents and aunts and uncles chip in too. A well-connected kid with lots of relatives can walk away from Seollal with a small fortune. I've heard Korean friends joke that Seollal was the highlight of their financial year until they started working.

Many families also wear **hanbok** (한복), the traditional Korean clothing, at least for the morning rituals. The silk fabric, vibrant colors, and flowing lines of hanbok look stunning, and Seollal is one of the few occasions when you'll see entire families dressed in them outside of a historical drama set. Younger Koreans have also started embracing modernized hanbok — simpler cuts, muted colors, more comfortable fabrics — that blend tradition with contemporary style.

There's an undercurrent of stress to Seollal as well, and it would be dishonest not to mention it. For married women especially, the holiday has traditionally meant days of cooking, cleaning, and serving while in-laws scrutinize everything. The phrase "명절 스트레스" (myeongjeol seuteuleseu) — holiday stress — is a real thing that gets discussed openly in Korean media every year. Things are gradually changing as younger couples push back on outdated expectations, but the tension between tradition and modern equality is very much alive.

## The Food of Seollal

You cannot talk about Seollal without talking about food, because the two are inseparable. The cooking starts days before the holiday, and the kitchen becomes the busiest room in the house.

The single most iconic Seollal dish is **tteokguk** (떡국), a clear beef broth soup filled with thin, oval-shaped slices of rice cake called tteok. Eating tteokguk on Seollal morning is essentially mandatory. There's a beloved cultural belief that you gain one year of age by eating a bowl. So when someone asks "몇 살이에요?" (how old are you?), a playful answer might be "I've eaten 30 bowls of tteokguk." If you skip it, well, some would jokingly say you haven't really aged that year. The soup itself is comforting — mild, savory, with the satisfying chew of the rice cakes. Every family has their own variation. Some add dumplings (making it tteok-manduguk), some use anchovy broth instead of beef, and some garnish with egg strips, seaweed, and scallions piled high.

Then there are the **jeon** (전), savory pancakes that appear in dizzying variety during the holiday. Hobakjeon (zucchini pancakes), dongtaejeon (pollack pancakes), gochujeon (chili pepper pancakes), and bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes) are all common. Making jeon is one of the most labor-intensive parts of Seollal prep. Someone stands at the stove for hours, dipping ingredients in egg batter and frying them one by one in a shallow pan. The smell of sesame oil and sizzling batter is basically the scent of Seollal itself.

**Japchae** (잡채) usually makes an appearance too — glass noodles stir-fried with vegetables, beef, and a sweet soy sauce glaze. It's a crowd-pleaser that works at room temperature, which is practical when you've got twenty dishes competing for table space. **Galbi-jjim** (갈비찜), braised short ribs in a sweet and savory sauce, is the showstopper on many families' tables. The meat falls off the bone after hours of slow cooking, and the sauce — soy, sugar, garlic, pear juice, sesame — is the kind of thing you want to pour over everything.

Fruit plays a bigger role than you might expect. Carefully selected apples, pears, persimmons, and jujubes are arranged on the charye table and later shared among the family. Korean pears during Seollal are enormous, juicy, and sweet — nothing like the small, grainy pears you might be used to. And for something sweet, families might have yakgwa (약과), a deep-fried honey cookie that's had a massive revival in recent years, or songpyeon left over from Chuseok that someone stashed in the freezer.

The sheer volume of food is staggering. Leftovers last for days, and by the end of the holiday, most people swear they'll eat nothing but salad for a week. They never do.

## Games and Activities During the Holiday

Once the rituals and feasting wind down, Seollal turns playful. This is when families break out the traditional games, and they're genuinely fun — not just something people do out of obligation.

**Yutnori** (윷놀이) is the undisputed king of Seollal games. It's a board game where teams throw four wooden sticks into the air, and the combination of flat and round sides that land up determines how many spaces you move your tokens. The rules are simple enough for a five-year-old, but the strategy gets surprisingly intense. Alliances form. Trash talk flies. Grandmothers who seemed half-asleep five minutes ago suddenly become ruthless competitors. Yutnori is loud, chaotic, and one of the best ways to bond with a Korean family. If you're ever invited to play, say yes immediately.

**Neolttwigi** (널뛰기) is a traditional seesaw game, but not the playground kind. Two people stand on opposite ends of a long board and jump, launching each other into the air. It looks terrifying and exhilarating in equal measure. You'll see it demonstrated at folk villages more than in modern homes, since most apartments don't have the outdoor space for it, but it remains a beloved symbol of the holiday.

Kite flying was historically a big part of Seollal as well. People would write their wishes and troubles on kites, fly them high, and then cut the string — symbolically letting go of bad luck. You'll still see kites at cultural events and folk villages during the holiday, though it's not as common in daily practice as it once was.

Then there's the modern Seollal tradition that nobody officially calls a tradition but absolutely is one: watching TV. Korean broadcasters roll out massive special programming during the holiday — variety shows, movie marathons, celebrity yutnori tournaments, and cooking specials. Families sprawl across the heated ondol floor, buried under blankets, snacking on leftover jeon and tangerines while half-watching whatever's on. It's cozy in a way that transcends culture.

For younger family members, Seollal also means hours of catching up with cousins. Card games, mobile gaming sessions, and these days, plenty of time comparing notes on school, work, and — inevitably — who's dating whom. Korean family gatherings are warm but nosy. Be prepared.

## Experiencing Seollal as a Foreigner in Korea

Here's the practical reality: if you're in Korea during Seollal and you're not spending it with a Korean family, the holiday can feel a little lonely. Most restaurants close. Tourist areas thin out. The usual buzz of Korean city life disappears. But with a little planning, Seollal can actually be one of the most memorable experiences you'll have in Korea.

**Folk villages** are your best bet for experiencing Seollal traditions firsthand. The Korean Folk Village in Yongin, about an hour south of Seoul, goes all out during the holiday with traditional performances, yutnori stations, hanbok rentals, and food stalls serving tteokguk and jeon. Namsangol Hanok Village in central Seoul offers a similar experience and is easier to reach by subway. Both places welcome foreigners and usually have some English signage and guides.

**Gyeongbokgung Palace** and the other major palaces in Seoul sometimes offer free admission during Seollal, along with special cultural programs. You might catch traditional music performances, martial arts demonstrations, or even participate in sebae practice sessions. Wearing hanbok to the palace — you can rent it from dozens of shops in the Bukchon area — gets you free entry year-round, but during Seollal it feels especially fitting.

If you're looking for food options when everything seems closed, head to areas with large foreigner populations. Itaewon, Hongdae, and parts of Gangnam tend to have more restaurants that stay open during holidays. International chain restaurants and hotel restaurants are reliable bets too. Many convenience stores remain open, and honestly, a GS25 or CU holiday meal deal with tteokguk and a few side dishes is a perfectly respectable Seollal dinner for one.

A few tips for navigating Seollal as a traveler. Train and bus tickets sell out weeks in advance, so if you're planning to travel between cities, book early — and I mean a month early at minimum. Flights get expensive too. On the flip side, Seoul itself becomes remarkably peaceful. Roads are clear. Popular spots have no crowds. If you've been wanting to visit Myeongdong or Bukchon without being shoulder-to-shoulder with other tourists, Seollal is your moment.

One more thing. If a Korean friend or colleague invites you to spend Seollal with their family, that's a significant gesture. Accept graciously. Bring a gift — a nice fruit box, quality Korean beef, or a gift set from a department store are all safe choices. Be ready to sit on the floor for hours, eat more than you thought physically possible, attempt sebae (your hosts will adore you for trying), and answer approximately forty questions about your home country, your job, and whether you're married. It's overwhelming, warm, and absolutely wonderful.

## Seollal Is More Than a Holiday

Seollal isn't just a long weekend or a cultural curiosity. It's the connective tissue of Korean family life — the one time of year when distance, busy schedules, and the relentless pace of modern Korea all take a backseat to being together. The traditions might look formal from the outside, but spend a Seollal with a Korean family and you'll see that underneath the bowing and the ritual and the carefully arranged food, it's really about the same thing holidays are about everywhere: love, connection, and eating way too much.

If you're in Korea during Seollal, lean into it. Try the tteokguk. Play yutnori. Wear hanbok. Bow to someone older than you and wish them a year full of blessings. You don't have to be Korean to appreciate what this holiday means — you just have to be open to it. And if nothing else, at least pick up a box of yakgwa from the nearest bakery. Trust me on that one.
