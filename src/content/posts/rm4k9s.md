My pantry has a dedicated ramen shelf. Not a corner, not a basket — a whole shelf. Three rows deep, sorted by brand. My husband thinks this is excessive. I think this is just called being prepared.

Here in Korea, ramen isn't just convenience food. It's comfort, it's nostalgia, it's what you make at 11pm when you're tired and the kids are finally asleep and you just need something good. My older son, who's 14, won't touch anything milder than Shin Ramyun. My younger son, who's 11, adds cheese to everything. And me? I have opinions. Strong ones.

So let me walk you through the ramen aisle — because if you've ever stood in a Korean mart staring at 50 different red and yellow packages wondering what any of it means, this guide is for you.

## The Ramen Aisle: Why Korea Has 200+ Varieties

Koreans consume somewhere around 3 to 4 billion servings of instant ramen per year. That's not a typo. For a country of 52 million people, that works out to something like 70 bowls per person annually. And we're proud of it.

The ramen industry here is fiercely competitive. Nongshim, Samyang, Ottogi, Paldo — these companies are constantly releasing new flavors, limited editions, and seasonal collaborations. Walk into any E-Mart or GS25 right now and there's probably something on the shelves that didn't exist six months ago.

The variety breaks down roughly like this: soup-based ramyun (국물 라면) where you cook in water and eat the broth, stir-fry ramyun (볶음면) where you drain the water and toss with a thick sauce, and cold noodles (비빔면) for summer. Then within each of those, you've got beef broth, seafood, kimchi, cheese, jjajang (black bean), budae (army stew) — the list doesn't stop.

The most important thing to know: not all red packages are equally spicy. This seems obvious but it has burned many tourists. I watched a man at a convenience store in Myeongdong pick up 2x Spicy Buldak thinking it was just regular ramen because it looked similar to what he'd had before. I wanted to stop him but I was too far away. He did not have a good time.

## My Top 10 Korean Ramens (and What Makes Each One Special)

Let me be honest with you. I've eaten all of these. Multiple times. Here's my real take.

**1. Shin Ramyun (신라면) — Nongshim**
The absolute classic. The benchmark. If you ask any Korean to picture "ramen," this is probably what they see. Deep, spicy beef broth with chewy noodles and a seasoning packet that smells incredible even before you open it. Spice level: medium. My mother-in-law has eaten this three times a week for thirty years. That should tell you something.

**2. Jin Ramen (진라면) — Ottogi**
The everyday workhorse. Comes in two versions — mild (순한맛) and spicy (매운맛). The mild version is what you make for kids who haven't graduated to Shin yet. My younger son went through a phase where he'd only eat the mild version with a slice of American cheese melted on top, and honestly? That combo is underrated. The broth is rounder and less aggressive than Shin.

**3. Buldak Bokkeummyun (불닭볶음면) — Samyang**
The one the whole world is doing challenges with. Fire chicken flavor. Thick chewy noodles, a thick chili sauce, a packet of sesame and dried seaweed. No broth — you drain the water and mix. It is very spicy. Not life-altering if you have any heat tolerance, but it'll make your forehead sweat. My older son eats it without flinching, which I'm choosing to see as a parenting success.

**4. Neoguri (너구리) — Nongshim**
Seafood udon style, thicker noodles, a slightly sweet and spicy broth with real dried kelp in the packet. This is the base ingredient for Chapaguri (더 on this in a minute). The udon-style noodles hold up better in a big pot, which is why Koreans love using Neoguri when cooking for more than one person. It also reheats better than most.

**5. Chapagetti (짜파게티) — Nongshim**
Jjajangmyun in instant form. Black bean sauce, chewy noodles, little bits of potato and onion in the packet. This is Korean Chinese food (there's a whole distinct cuisine called jungwha, Chinese-influenced Korean food) made convenient. You drain most of the water and toss with the sauce — similar to the stir-fry style. Kids love this one. It's savory and a little sweet with no real heat.

**6. Chapaguri (짜파구리)**
Okay technically this isn't a single product but I have to include it. You mix Chapagetti and Neoguri together. One Chapagetti packet, one Neoguri packet, cook the noodles together and combine the sauce packets. The Parasite movie made this famous internationally, but we were making this long before. It's genuinely delicious — you get the black bean depth plus the seafood spice. Add a fried egg on top and it's a meal.

**7. Ansung Tang Myun (안성탕면) — Nongshim**
This one doesn't get enough international attention. Older Koreans love it — it was one of the earliest Korean instant ramens and it has this comforting, mild, slightly tangy broth that tastes like something a grandmother would make. If Shin Ramyun is the college student ramen, Ansung Tang Myun is the parent's ramen. Spice level: low. Very approachable for people who can't handle heat.

**8. Budae Jjigae Ramyun (부대찌개 라면) — Ottogi**
Army stew flavored instant ramen. The original budae jjigae is a dish from the post-Korean War era made with leftover American military rations — spam, hot dogs, baked beans — mixed with Korean kimchi and gochujang. The instant version captures that weird, deeply satisfying mix of sweet-spicy-savory. It's not the most refined flavor but it's uniquely Korean and it's good.

**9. Kimchi Ramyun (김치라면) — Nongshim**
Exactly what it sounds like. Bright kimchi flavor, a little sour, medium spicy. If you like kimchi, you'll like this. If you're new to kimchi flavor and want to test the waters in a low-stakes way before trying actual kimchi, this is a good entry point. The broth is punchy and a little fermented in flavor.

**10. 2x Spicy Buldak (핵불닭볶음면) — Samyang**
I include this as a warning as much as a recommendation. This is the black package with the angry cartoon chicken. It's roughly twice as hot as regular Buldak. My husband tried to finish a bowl on a dare from our older son and needed to lie down afterward. Some people love extreme heat — if you're one of them, this is your ramen. Everyone else: proceed carefully.

## How Koreans Actually Eat Ramen (Our Secret Add-Ins)

Here's where I'll let you in on something. When you see Korean ramen in dramas or movies, they always look so simple — just the noodles in the pot. But in real life? We add things. Many things.

**The egg is non-negotiable.** Almost every Korean who cooks ramen at home cracks an egg in. The question is when — some crack it in the last minute of cooking so it sets partially, some crack it in at the very end for a runny yolk, some scramble it in during cooking. I crack mine in right at the end and put a lid on for 30 seconds. Semi-set, still a little runny. Perfect.

**Cheese.** American cheese slice, mozzarella, whatever you have. This sounds strange until you try it with Shin Ramyun and realize the creaminess cuts the heat perfectly. My younger son discovered this on his own and honestly the kid is a culinary genius.

**Green onions (파).** Always. Cut them in at the last minute. They add freshness and color and make the whole thing feel more like real food.

**Rice cakes (떡).** Cylindrical tteok chopped into pieces, added during cooking. They become chewy and absorb the broth and add substance. This is especially good with spicy broths.

**Spam or sausage.** A few slices of spam fried in a pan first, then added to the ramen. This is a leftover from budae jjigae culture but it works in regular ramen too. Very popular with kids.

**Kimchi.** Not from a packet — actual refrigerator kimchi, a big spoonful dropped in during cooking. It brightens everything and adds fermented depth. My go-to when I want the ramen to feel more homemade.

**The trick nobody tells you about:** Use less water than the package says. Most Korean ramyun packages tell you to use 550ml of water. I use about 450ml. The broth concentrates, the seasoning hits harder, and the noodles come out slightly chewier. Try it once and you'll never go back to the full amount.

## Spice Level Guide: From Mild to "Why Did I Do This"

Since this comes up constantly — here's a rough honest ranking of the common ones from least to most spicy:

**Mild (green light for everyone):**
- Ansung Tang Myun
- Jin Ramen Mild (진라면 순한맛)
- Chapagetti
- Bibimmyun (the cold noodles — spicy sauce but you can control how much you use)

**Medium (some heat, very manageable):**
- Neoguri
- Jin Ramen Spicy (진라면 매운맛)
- Kimchi Ramyun
- Budae Jjigae Ramyun

**Spicy (you'll feel it, you'll be fine):**
- Shin Ramyun
- Shin Ramyun Black (richer and spicier than original)
- Regular Buldak Bokkeummyun

**Hot (know what you're getting into):**
- Buldak Carbonara — don't be fooled by "carbonara," it still bites
- Curry Buldak

**Extreme (for spice people only):**
- 2x Spicy Buldak
- Habanero-flavored editions when they release them

One thing I always tell foreign friends: Korean spicy is a different kind of spicy than, say, Southeast Asian spicy. Gochugaru (Korean red pepper) has a fruity, bright heat that builds gradually. It's less about instant burn and more about a slow warmth that creeps up on you. This means people sometimes underestimate it and eat too much before realizing how hot they are. Go slow with the first bowl. You can always go hotter.

## One Last Thing

The best ramen I ever had wasn't from a restaurant or a cooking show. It was a bowl of Shin Ramyun my mother made me on a freezing winter night when I came home late from studying for college entrance exams. She'd added an egg, some green onions, and a piece of kimchi she'd made herself. It was on the table in ten minutes. It was perfect.

That's what Korean ramen is, really. It's not fast food. It's fast comfort. And there's a difference.

Now go find a Korean mart, buy five different packages, and do your own ranking. You won't regret it. And if you need guidance on any of them, you know where to find me.
