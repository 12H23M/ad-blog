    <h1>About Baksuls</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      Hi there. I'm a Korean mom in my forties living in Seoul, and this blog is my way of
      sharing the Korea I know and love with the rest of the world.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I've spent most of my life in Korea — raising a family, cooking way too much food
        for every occasion, and dragging my kids to historical sites they pretend not to enjoy.
        Travel, cooking, and history are the three things I never get tired of, and Korea
        happens to be one of the best places on earth for all three.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started Baksuls because I kept running into the same problem: friends visiting from
        abroad would ask me where to eat, what to see, or how something in Korea works, and
        I'd end up writing them small essays. Eventually I figured I should just put it all
        in one place.

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>
        This blog covers the Korea I actually experience — not the glossy tourist brochure
        version, but the real stuff. The neighborhood restaurant with no English menu that
        makes the best kimchi jjigae you'll ever taste. The Joseon-era fortress you can hike
        to in twenty minutes from a subway station. The small cultural habits that confuse
        newcomers and the context that makes them make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write about <strong>food</strong> because I genuinely believe Korean cuisine is one
        of the most underrated in the world, and I want more people to know what to order
        beyond bibimbap. I write about <strong>travel</strong> because Korea has far more to
        offer than Seoul and Jeju, and some of my favorite spots are places most visitors
        never hear about. And I write about <strong>culture</strong> and <strong>history</strong>
        because understanding where Korea comes from makes everything you see here more
        interesting.

      <h2>Why "Baksuls"</h2>
      <p>
        박술 (baksul) is a casual way of saying "knack" or "know-how" in Korean — the kind
        of practical wisdom you pick up from experience, not textbooks. That's what I'm trying
        to share here: the things you learn from actually living in and loving this country.
        The "s" at the end is just to make it work in English.
